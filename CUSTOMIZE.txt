=================================================================


This file contains detailed instructions for customizing your Logtalk 
installation and working environment. Customization is mostly done on 
a per-user basis by editing files on the Logtalk user folder (whose 
path is stored on the LOGTALKUSER environment variable; the folder itself 
can be created by running the "cplgtdirs" shell command).


1. SETTING LIBRARY PATHS

In Logtalk, a library is simply a directory containing source files. Library 
paths can be declared using a dynamic predicate. This allows compiling and 
loading of libraries and library files to be performed without worries about 
library paths.

Inside your Logtalk user folder, you will find a "libpaths" folder containing 
a sample file which, when loaded, defines the library paths for the Logtalk 
standard library and for all the supplied examples. This file may need to be 
edited to match both your Logtalk installation and your Prolog compiler and 
operating-system requirements. For details, see the file "libpaths/NOTES".


2. CUSTOMIZING PROLOG CONFIGURATION FILES

Logtalk interfaces with a specific Prolog compiler via a configuration file 
that can be found on the "configs" folder inside your Logtalk user folder.
These configuration files can be customized by changing the values of the 
default flags that are used by Logtalk when compiling source files. For a 
full description of these default flags, consult the "Running and debugging 
Logtalk programs" section of the User Manual. Some of the default flags that 
you may want to change include: "smart_compilation", "startup_message", 
"portability", "underscore_vars", "altdirs", and the set of documentation-
related flags ("xmldocs", "xslfile", "xmlspec", and "xmlsref"). Be sure to 
read the "configs/NOTES" file for Prolog specific notes; some Prolog compilers
do not support the whole range of compilation flag values.  


3. CUSTOMIZING DOCUMENTATION PROCESSING SCRIPTS AND SUPPORTING FILES

Inside your Logtalk user folder, you will find a "xml" folder containing a 
set of shell scripts, CSS and XSLT style-sheets, and DTD and XML Schema files 
for processing the XML documenting files that are automatically generated 
when you compile source files. You may want to customize the CSS and XSLT 
files to modify the layout or style of the resulting PDF/(X)HTML files or to 
write new scripts and transformations to generate other formats. You may also 
edit the file "custom.ent" in order to specify XML entities for your personal 
data that can be used on Logtalk documenting directives. For details, see the 
file "xml/NOTES".


4. ADDING SUPPORT FOR EDITING LOGTALK SOURCE FILES TO TEXT EDITORS

Inside your Logtalk user folder, you will find a "wenv" folder, containing 
configuration files for several text editors, which add support for syntax 
coloring and other editing services of Logtalk source files. For details, 
see the file "wenv/NOTES".
