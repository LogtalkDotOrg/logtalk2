================================================================


This file contains detailed instructions for customizing your Logtalk 
installation and working environment. Customization is mostly done on
a per-user basis by editing a settings file on the Logtalk user folder 
(whose path is stored on the LOGTALKUSER environment variable; this folder 
can be (re)created by running the "logtalk_user_setup" shell command). The
default path for the Logtalk user folder is:

	POSIX systems: $HOME/logtalk
	Windows: My Documents\Logtalk


1. DEFINING A DEFAULT PROLOG BACK-END COMPILER FOR LOGTALK

Users of POSIX systems may use the "logtalk_backend_select" shell command
to define an alias, "logtalk", for one of the provided back-end Prolog
compiler integration scripts.


2. SETTING LIBRARY PATHS

In Logtalk, a library is simply a directory containing source files. Library 
paths can be declared using a dynamic, multifile predicate. This allows 
compiling and loading of libraries and library files using the library names
instead of the full library paths.

Inside your Logtalk user folder, you will find a "libpaths" folder containing 
a sample file which, when loaded, defines the library paths for the Logtalk 
standard library and for all the supplied examples. This file may need to be 
edited to match both your Logtalk installation and your Prolog compiler and 
operating-system requirements. For details, see the "libpaths/NOTES.txt" file.

Library paths for your own source files directories are preferably defined in
your settings file, described next.


3. CUSTOMIZING LOGTALK SETTINGS

Logtalk interfaces with a specific Prolog compiler using a configuration file 
that can be found on the "configs" folder in the Logtalk installation folder.
These configuration files define default values of the flags that are used by
Logtalk when compiling source files (for a full description of these flags, 
consult the "Writing, Running, and Debugging Logtalk Programs" section of the
User Manual).

You may customize the Logtalk compiler flags by editing the "settings.lgt"
file in the Logtalk user folder. Settings in this file override the default 
values in the configuration files. Some of the default flag values that you
may want to change include:

* "startup_message" and "report"
- for less verbose startup and compilation reports
* "altdirs", "tmpdir", and "xmldir"
- to chose where to store temporary compilation files and documenting files
* "xmldocs", "xslfile", "xmlspec", and "xmlsref"
- to control the generation of documenting files
* "portability" and "underscore_variables"
- essential if you're writing portable Logtalk applications
* "smart_compilation"
- for avoiding recompilation of unchanged source files

Be sure to read the "configs/NOTES.txt" file for Prolog specific compatibility
notes; some back-end Prolog compilers don't support all the possible compilation
flags values. In addition, some back-end Prolog compilers provide limited or no
support for settings files.

You may also use the "settings.lgt" file in the Logtalk user folder to define
your own library paths. See the provided "settings.lgt" file for details.


4. CUSTOMIZING DOCUMENTATION PROCESSING SCRIPTS AND SUPPORTING FILES

Inside your Logtalk user folder, you will find a "xml" folder containing a 
set of shell scripts, CSS and XSLT style-sheets, and DTD and XML Schema files 
for processing the XML documenting files that are automatically generated 
when you compile source files. You may want to customize the CSS and XSLT 
files to modify the layout or style of the resulting PDF/(X)HTML files or to 
write new scripts and transformations to generate other formats. You may also 
edit the file "custom.ent" in order to specify XML entities for your personal 
data that can be used on Logtalk documenting directives. For details, see the 
"xml/NOTES.txt" file.


5. ADDING SUPPORT TO TEXT EDITORS FOR EDITING LOGTALK SOURCE FILES

Inside your Logtalk user folder, you will find a "wenv" folder, containing 
configuration files for several text editors, which add support for syntax 
highlighting and other text editing services for Logtalk source files.
For details, see the "wenv/NOTES.txt" file.
