=================================================================


Quick start
===========


1. Install Logtalk by using either the installer provided for your 
operating-system (when available) or by following the instructions 
on the "INSTALL" file. Depending on your operating-system, working 
environment, and favorite Prolog compiler, you may already have a 
script or a shortcut installed for easily running Logtalk with your 
favorite Prolog compiler. If so, skip the instructions below for 
starting up Logtalk.

2. Open the "manuals/index.html" file with a web browser.

3. Select the "Tutorial" link. This will provide you with a basic 
understanding of the main Logtalk concepts.

4. Go back to the "index.html" file and select the "User Manual" 
link and then the Installing and running Logtalk links. This will 
provide you with a basic understanding of how to start Logtalk and 
compile and load Logtalk code.


Assuming that Logtalk supports your Prolog compiler:

1. Read the "NOTES" file in the "configs" sub-directory to check if 
any patch or workaround is needed for your compiler.

2. Start your Prolog compiler.

3. Change the current working directory of your Prolog session to the 
Logtalk installation directory. If you don't know which predicate to 
use, check the "configs/NOTES" file or your Prolog compiler reference 
manual.

4. Compile and load the config file for your Prolog compiler.

5. Compile and load the Logtalk compiler/runtime found on the "compiler" 
sub-directory.

6. Adapt, if needed, the file "libpaths/libpaths.pl" to match your Logtalk 
installation, Prolog compiler, and operating-system, and then compile and 
load it.

Note that both the configuration files, the compiler/runtime files, and the 
library paths file are Prolog files. The predicate used to load these files 
depends on your Prolog compiler (consult your Prolog compiler documentation 
or take a look at the definition of the predicate '$lgt_load_prolog_code'/1 
in the config file. For most command-line compilers, you could type at the 
Prolog prompt something like:

	| ?- ['configs/foo.config', 'compiler/logtalk.pl', 'libpaths/libpaths.pl'].

Replace the file name foo.config with the appropriated config file name for 
your compiler.


Now you may try some of the included examples:

1. Open the examples sub-directory. There you find several sub-directories
with ready to run examples and a NOTES file containing general instructions 
and a brief description of each example. Select and open one of the examples 
sub-directory.

2. Read the example NOTES file for a description of the example.

3. Open the SCRIPT file for instructions on how to load the example and for 
sample queries that you may try by copying-and-pasting or dragging-and-droping
them on your Prolog interpreter top-level.


Ready to start writing your own programs?

1. Read the User Manual sections on "Programming in Logtalk" and "Running 
and debugging Logtalk programs".

2. Take a look at the "wenv" sub-directory. There you will find syntax 
configuration files for popular text editors that enable syntax coloring 
and other goodies when editing Logtalk source files.

3. Create a sub-directory with a suitable name to hold all the files of 
your application. You may want to add the directory path to the libpaths.pl 
file mentioned above in order to easily load your application.

4. Copy to this sub-directory a loader file from one of the example 
directories and modify it to load your own source files.

5. Have fun!
