This folder contains some useful objects, categories, and protocols. 

To load a group of objects, protocols, and categories in this library 
either change your Prolog working directory to this folder and then 
compile and load the corresponding loader utility file or simply use 
the notation library(<loader file>) as argument for the compiling and 
loading predicates. For example:

	| ?- logtalk_load(library(random_loader)).

Currently, there are ten groups of entities defined, each one with its 
own loader and notes files:

	dates
		dates_loader.lgt
		dates.txt

	debugging
		debugging_loader.lgt
		debugging.txt

	dependents
		dependents_loader.lgt
		dependents.txt

	events
		events_loader.lgt
		events.txt

	hierarchies
		hierarchies_loader.lgt
		hierarchies.txt

	lgtunit
		lgtunit_loader.lgt
		lgtunit.txt

	metapredicates
		metapredicates_loader.lgt
		metapredicates.txt

	random
		random_loader.lgt
		random.txt

	statistics
		statistics_loader.lgt
		statistics.txt

	types
		types_loader.lgt
		types.txt

There is also a file named all_loader.lgt that will load all entities in the 
groups listed above. Simply type the goal:

	| ?- logtalk_load(library(all_loader)).

Specific notes about each group of objects, categories, and protocols can be 
found in the corresponding *.txt files.

Some of the files contained in this directory represent work in progress and 
are not loaded by default by any loader utility file.

Some of the code in this library is based on public domain Prolog code, in 
particular, code adopted from the Edinburgh Prolog library. The definition 
of predicate reverse/2 in object list is from Richard O'Keefe and can be found 
in its book "The Craft of Prolog".

By default, compiling any group of entities described above generates a .xml 
documenting file for each compiled entity (object, category, or protocol).
See the xml sub-directory for instructions on how to browse the .xml files 
for on-line reading or how to convert the files to a print-ready format such 
as PDF.

All source files are formatted using four-space tabs.

To generate documentation of the Logtalk libraries, start Logtalk with your
favorite back-end Prolog compiler and type the query:

| ?- {library(all_loader)}.

Next, run the command "lgt2html" on the "library" directory inside your
Logtalk user directory to generate (X)HTML documentation or the command
"lgt2pdf" to generate PDF documentation (if you turned on the "altdirs"
compiler option, then run the lgt2* commands in the directory set by the
"xmldir" compiler flag instead).
