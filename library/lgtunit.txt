================================================================


The "lgtunit.lgt" file contains a simple framework for defining 
and running unit tests in Logtalk. To compile and load it type:

	| ?- logtalk_load(library(lgtunit)).

The unit tests framework is inspired on the works of Joachim Schimpf 
(ECLiPSe library "test_util") and Jan Wielemaker (SWI-Prolog "plunit" 
package).

In order to write your own unit tests, define objects extending the 
"lgtunit" object. These objects must be compiled using the compiler
option hook(lgtunit). For example:

| ?- logtalk_load(my_tests, [hook(lgtunit)]).

When using the <</2 control construct to access and test an object
internal predicates, make sure that the "context_switching_calls" 
compiler flag is set to "allow" for those objects.

For examples of how to write unit tests check the "testing" example 
in the "examples" folder in the Logtalk distribution.
