================================================================


The "lgtunit.lgt" file contains a preliminary framework for defining 
and running unit tests in Logtalk. To compile and load it type:

	| ?- logtalk_load(library(lgtunit)).

The unit tests framework is inspired on the works of Joachim Schimpf 
(ECLiPSe library "test_util") and Jan Wielemaker (SWI-Prolog "plunit" 
package).

In order to write your own unit tests, define objects extending the 
"lgtunit" object and use the <</2 context-switching call control 
construct to write the tests. Make sure that the read-only compiler 
flag "context_switching_calls" is set to "allow" in the config file 
of your back-end Prolog compiler.

For an example of how to write unit tests check the "testing" example 
in the "examples" folder in the Logtalk distribution.
