The "lgtunit.lgt" file contains a preliminary framework for defining 
and running unit tests in Logtalk. To compile and load it type:

	| ?- logtalk_load(library(lgtunit)).

The unit tests framework is inspired on the works of Joachim Schimpf 
(ECLiPSe library "test_util") and Jan Wielemaker (SWI-Prolog "plunit" 
package).
