================================================================


The recommended way of installing Logtalk is to use, whenever possible, one 
of the provided installers. This file contains detailed instructions for 
*manual* installation and configuration of Logtalk. You should also consult 
the "scripts/NOTES.txt" and "integration/NOTES.txt" files for a description 
of a set of shell scripts that might be used for Logtalk installation on 
some operating-systems and for easy Logtalk integration with popular Prolog 
compilers.

The POSIX shell scripts assume that "/bin/bash" is available.


1. LOGTALK BASIC INSTALLATION

Manual installation of Logtalk can be accomplished by decompressing the
downloaded archive (or checking out a Logtalk working copy from the official
Subversion server), running an installation script, and defining a couple of
environment variables. You can install Logtalk in any user accessible location.
Whenever possible, it is recommended that Logtalk be installed by a user with
administrative rights, as described below. This leads to a setup where each
Logtalk user may freely try and modify the provided examples, library, and
configuration files with the option of, at any time, restoring the files to
its original state by simply running one of the provided scripts.


* Installing for a single user with no administrative rights:

For POSIX systems, first, open a terminal, change the current directory to
the Logtalk directory, and then type:

	% cd scripts
	% ./install.sh $HOME

This will install Logtalk into the $HOME/share and $HOME/bin directories (the
$HOME/bin path must be in your PATH environment variable).

If you're using Windows, you can simply use the provided installer (which
supports both admin and non-admin users) to perform a full installation.


* Installing for one or more users by a user with administrative rights:

For POSIX systems, first, open a terminal, change the current directory to
the Logtalk directory, and then type:

	% cd scripts
	% sudo ./install.sh

This installation script makes all files read-only for non-admin users in 
order to avoid user tempering. This is a convenient setup for computer labs, 
given that making directories world-writable is a security risk. The install
script accepts an installation prefix as argument. For example:

	% sudo ./install.sh /opt/local

If no prefix is given, the default installation prefix depends on the
operating-system:

	Mac OS X:				/opt/local
	Debian distributions:	/usr
	Other POSIX systems:	/usr/local		

The script installs Logtalk in the "$prefix/share" directory with useful
scripts written to the "$prefix/bin" directory, which should be in your path.

If you're using Windows, you can simply use the provided GUI installer (which
supports both admin and non-admin users) to perform a full installation.


2. SETTING LOGTALK ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

You need to set two environment variables, LOGTALKHOME and LOGTALKUSER. The 
environment variable LOGTALKHOME should be set to the Logtalk installation 
directory. The environment variable LOGTALKUSER should point to a directory 
in your home directory where you want to store the user-specific Logtalk files
(by default, "$HOME/logtalk" on POSIX systems and "My Documents\Logtalk" on 
Windows"). Both environment variables may be set for all users by a user with 
administration privileges.

For POSIX systems, add the following lines to your ~/.profile file:

	LOGTALKHOME=/your/logtalk/installation/directory
	LOGTALKUSER=$HOME/logtalk
	PATH=$PATH:$LOGTALKHOME/xml:$LOGTALKHOME/scripts:$LOGTALKHOME/integration
	MANPATH=$MANPATH:$LOGTALKHOME/man
	export LOGTALKHOME LOGTALKUSER PATH MANPATH

If you use instead a csh shell, add the following line to your ~/.cshrc file:

	setenv LOGTALKHOME /your/logtalk/installation/directory
	setenv LOGTALKUSER $HOME/logtalk
	setenv PATH $PATH:$LOGTALKHOME/xml:$LOGTALKHOME/scripts:$LOGTALKHOME/integration
	setenv MANPATH $MANPATH:$LOGTALKHOME/man

Don't use relative paths such as ../ or ./ in the definition of the environment
variables. Some Prolog compilers don't expand environment variables, resulting
in "file not found" errors when attempting to use the Logtalk integration scripts.

When using the provided shell script for installing Logtalk, a symbolic link 
to the Logtalk installation directory is automatically created. The link is 
named "logtalk". In this case, you may use this symbolic link to define the 
LOGTALKHOME environment variable in order to avoid breaking it when upgrading 
Logtalk.

If you're using Windows, the provided GUI installer (which supports both admin
and non-admin users) takes care of the definition of the environment variables.


3. END-USER SETUP (COPYING LOGTALK USER-MODIFIABLE FILES TO USERS HOME DIRS)

If you installed Logtalk on your home directory, then skip this step if and only
if you have set both Logtalk environment variables (LOGTALKHOME and LOGTALKUSER)
to point to the same directory.

Each user must make a local copy of the Logtalk user-modifiable files
(examples, libraries, and other supporting files) in his/her home directory.
These copies can be easily made by running the "logtalk_user_setup" shell
script  (see the "scripts/NOTES.txt" file for details):

>> POSIX systems:

	% logtalk_user_setup

>> Windows:

	C:\> logtalk_user_setup

The local copies made by the "logtalk_user_setup" scripts have both read and
write permissions for the user running the script. When used with one of the 
back-end Prolog compilers for which an integration script is provided on 
the "integration" directory, this setup as the advantage of allowing each 
end-user to independently customize default compilation options, library 
paths, and modify and experiment with the provided libraries and examples.

Windows (admin and non-admin) users may also use the Logtalk GUI installer
to setup their Logtalk user folder and the LOGTALKUSER environment variable.


4. CREATING NEW PROLOG TOP-LEVELS FOR AUTOMATIC LOADING OF LOGTALK

Most Prolog compilers allows the user to define an initialization file that
is automatically consulted at startup. These initialization files may contain
directives for loading other files, such as the Logtalk configuration file 
and the Logtalk compiler. The "$LOGTALKHOME/integration" sub-directory 
contains several pre-made scripts (named "*lgt.*") for running Logtalk with 
selected back-end Prolog compilers. You can use these scripts as examples 
when creating initialization files for other Prolog compilers. Be sure to 
read the "configs/NOTES.txt" file notes on the Prolog compilers that you 
intend to use.


5. CUSTOMIZING LOGTALK

Please see the file "CUSTOMIZE.txt" for details on how to customize your 
Logtalk installation and working environment.
