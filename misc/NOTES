=================================================================


This directory contains miscellaneous files used in Logtalk packaging, 
installation, and integration with Prolog compilers. Several scripts are 
included. Those with extension .sh are shell scripts for MacOS X, Linux, 
and similar systems. Those with extension .js are JScript command-line 
scripts for Windows; they require WSH 5.6 or later version to be installed.


lgt_install.sh
	shell script for installing Logtalk in a system-wide location for Unix and 
	Unix-like operating systems (must be run from this directory by a user with 
	administration privileges); accepts as an optional argument a prefix for the 
	installation directory (default is /usr/local)

logtalk.spec
	specification file for building Linux RPMs
	(copy the Logtalk tarball to your RPM SOURCES directory and then 
	run the command: rpmbuild -ba --target=noarch-*-linux logtalk.spec)

cplgtdirs.sh
cplgtdirs.js
	sample scripts for the copying xml, examples, and library directories to the 
	user home directory (must be run by the end-user to ensure proper permissions 
	on the copied files)

cleandist.sh
	script for cleaning a Logtalk distribution in preparation for 
	packaging.

debian
	directory containing support files for building a Debian package
	(work in progress; not yet functional)


The following shell scripts must be run by a user with administration 
privileges:

make_ciaolgt.sh
	makes a script named ciaolgt for running Logtalk with CIAO Prolog

make_eclipselgt.sh
	makes a script named eclipselgt for running Logtalk with ECLiPSe
make_eclipselgt.js
	makes a shortcut named eclipselgt for running Logtalk with ECLiPSe

make_gplgt.sh
	makes a script named gplgt for running Logtalk with GNU Prolog

make_qplgt.sh
	makes a script named qplgt for running Logtalk with Qu-Prolog 
	(based on script code contributed by Peter Robinson)

make_sicstuslgt.sh
	makes a script named sicstuslgt for running Logtalk with SICStus Prolog
make_sicstuslgt.js
	makes a shortcut named sicstuslgt for running Logtalk with SICStus Prolog

make_swilgt.sh
	makes a script named swilgt for running Logtalk with SWI-Prolog
make_swilgt.js
	makes a shortcut named swilgt for running Logtalk with SWI-Prolog

make_yaplgt.sh
	makes a script named yaplgt for running Logtalk with YAP

make_xsblgt.sh
	makes a script named xsblgt for running Logtalk with XSB

These scripts require the environment variable LOGTALKHOME (pointing to the 
Logtalk installation directory) to be defined. In addition, they accept as 
an optional argument a prefix for the location of a link to the scripts 
(default is /usr/local, creating the links in /usr/local/bin). Please note 
that the environment variable LOGTALKHOME must be defined in order to run 
the *lgt scripts that are created by the shell scripts above.

Note: when Logtalk is manually installed from sources, the shell scripts might 
not have the executable permission bit set. In that case it will be necessary 
to first run the command "chmod a+x *.sh" on the scripts directory.
