Logtalk - Object oriented extension to Prolog

=================================================================


This directory contains miscellaneous files used in Logtalk packaging, 
installation, and integration with Prolog compilers. Several scripts are 
included. Those with extension .sh are shell scripts for MacOS X, Linux, 
and similar systems. Those with extension .js are JScript command-line 
scripts for Windows; they require WSH 5.6 or later version to be installed
and should be run using cscript.exe from a DOS shell command line.


lgt_install.sh
	shell script for installing Logtalk in a system-wide location for Unix 
	and Unix-like operating systems (must be run from this directory by a 
	user with administration privileges); accepts as an optional argument 
	a prefix for the installation directory, default is /usr/local)
lgt_install.js
	Windows 2000/XP JScript script for completing the Logtalk installation by 
	setting the LOGTALKHOME system environment variable and the LOGTALKUSER 
	user environment variable (for the user performing the installation), by 
	creating a new program group named "Logtalk" in the Windows Start Menu, 
	and by adding the directories %LOGTALKHOME%\misc and %LOGTALKHOME%\xml to 
	the system path environment variable (must be run from this directory by 
	a user with administration privileges after decompressing the Logtalk 
	distribution into its final destination; you will need to restart your 
	computer in order to use the items created in the "Logtalk" program group 
	due to the definition of new system environment variables)

logtalk.spec
	specification file for building Linux RPMs
	(copy the Logtalk tarball to your RPM SOURCES directory and then 
	run the command: rpmbuild -ba --target=noarch-*-linux logtalk.spec)

cplgtdirs.sh
cplgtdirs.js
	end-user scripts for copying the Logtalk user-modifiable files and 
	directories to the location pointed by the environment variable 
	LOGTALKUSER (defaults to ~/logtalk on Unix-like operating-systems 
	and to My Documents\logtalk on Windows when the variable is not 
	defined); must be run by the end-user in order to ensure proper 
	permissions on the copied files

cleandist.sh
	script for cleaning a Logtalk distribution in preparation for packaging

debian
	directory containing support files for building a Debian package
	(work in progress; not yet functional)


The following scripts allow easy integration of Logtalk with selected Prolog 
compilers; they must be run by a user with administration privileges:

make_ciaolgt.sh
	makes a shell script named "ciaolgt" for running Logtalk with CIAO Prolog
	(the first run of the ciaolgt script must be made as root or using sudo)
make_ciaolgt.js
	makes a Windows shortcut named "Logtalk - CIAO" for running Logtalk with 
	CIAO 1.10 (the first call to the shortcut must be made by a user with 
	administrative rights)

make_eclipselgt.sh
	makes a shell script named "eclipselgt" for running Logtalk with ECLiPSe
make_eclipselgt.js
	makes a Windows shortcut named "Logtalk - ECLiPSe" for running Logtalk 
	with ECLiPSe 5.8 (if you are using a different version, you must edit 
	the reference to the registry key in the script; if you prefer to use
	TkEclipse, open the %LOGTALKHOME%\bin\logtalke_eclipse.pl file with it)

make_gplgt.sh
	makes a shell script named "gplgt" for running Logtalk with GNU Prolog (this 
	script is adequate for development purposes but does not provide the best 
	possible performance for running Logtalk with this Prolog compiler; for 
	optimal performance, see the configs/NOTES file)
make_gplgt.js
	makes a Windows shortcut named "Logtalk - GNU Prolog" for running Logtalk 
	with GNU Prolog (this script is adequate for development purposes but does 
	not provide the best possible performance for running Logtalk with this 
	Prolog compiler; for optimal performance, see the configs/NOTES file)

make_plclgt.sh
	makes a shell script named "plclgt" for running Logtalk with K-Prolog	
make_plclgt.js
	makes a Windows shortcut named "Logtalk - K-Prolog" for running Logtalk 
	with K-Prolog

make_qplgt.sh
	makes a shell script named "qplgt" for running Logtalk with Qu-Prolog 
	(based on script code contributed by Peter Robinson)

make_sicstuslgt.sh
	makes a shell script named "sicstuslgt" for running Logtalk with SICStus 
	Prolog
make_sicstuslgt.js
	makes a Windows shortcut named "Logtalk - SICStus Prolog" for running 
	Logtalk with SICStus Prolog 3.12 (if you are using a different version, 
	you must edit the reference to the registry key in the script)

make_swilgt.sh
	makes a shell script named "swilgt" for running Logtalk with SWI-Prolog
make_swilgt.js
	makes a Windows shortcut named "Logtalk - SWI-Prolog" for running Logtalk 
	with SWI-Prolog

make_yaplgt.sh
	makes a shell script named "yaplgt" for running Logtalk with YAP
make_yaplgt.js
	makes a Windows shortcut named "Logtalk - YAP" for running Logtalk with 
	YAP (assumes that the Yap folder is installed in C:\Program Files; edit 
	the path to the yap.exe executable in the script if necessary)

make_xsblgt.sh
	makes a shell script named "xsblgt" for running Logtalk with XSB (the 
	first run of the xsblgt script must be made as root or using sudo; each 
	user will need to rename the file configs/xsbXX.config to configs/xsb.P 
	and make and edit a copy of the libpaths/libpaths.pl in order to replace 
	all occurrences of the LOGTALKUSER environment variable with its value; 
	the new file should also use the .P extension)

These scripts require the environment variable LOGTALKHOME (pointing to the 
Logtalk installation directory) to be defined. The *.sh shell scripts 
accept as an optional argument a prefix for the location of a link to the 
scripts (default is /usr/local, creating the links in /usr/local/bin). The 
*.js scripts add the created shortcuts to the "Logtalk" program group (which 
is accessed from the Windows Start Menu).

Please note that the environment variables LOGTALKHOME and LOGTALKUSER must 
be defined in order to run the *lgt scripts that are created by the shell 
scripts above or the Windows shortcuts (see the INSTALL file for details on 
setting the variables).

Note: when Logtalk is manually installed from sources, the shell scripts 
might not have the executable permission bit set. In that case it will 
be necessary to first run the command "chmod a+x *.sh" on the "misc" and 
"xml" directories.
