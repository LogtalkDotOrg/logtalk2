=================================================================


Installing Logtalk is just a matter of decompressing the downloaded 
archive and copying the resulting directory to a suitable location. 
The Logtalk directory can reside in any user accessible location. 
This location depends on the working environment and on the number 
of users.

See the user manual for a description of the source files organization 
and for installing/using instructions (to read the user manual open the 
file manuals/index.html with a web browser). Most files are formatted 
using four-space tabs.


INSTALLING FOR A SINGLE USER

In the case of a single user, the Logtalk directory can be copied to 
the user home directory.


INSTALLING FOR MULTIPLE USERS

In the case of multiple users, the Logtalk directory can be copied to 
any location that its accessible by all the users.

Regarding directory and file permissions, it is desirable to make all 
files read-only in order to avoid user tempering. However, the library 
and examples sub-directories must be user writable as compiling Logtalk 
source files generates intermediate Prolog files, which are written to 
the same location as the source files. In alternative, the library and 
example files may be pre-compiled and the "smart_compilation" compiler 
option turned to avoid the need of recompilation when the files are 
loaded by the users.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

In Unix and Unix-like systems you may want to define an environment variable 
named $LOGTALKHOME pointing to the Logtalk installation for use with your 
Prolog compilers. If you use a csh shell, add the following line to your 
.cshrc file:

	setenv LOGTALKHOME "/your/installation/directory/lgt2170"

If you use a bash shell, add the following lines to your .profile file:

	LOGTALKHOME="/your/installation/directory/lgt2170"
	export LOGTALKHOME
