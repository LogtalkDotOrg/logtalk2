This directory contains files that provide syntax highlighting and 
other editing services for writing Logtalk source files (*.lgt) with 
common text editors. By default, Logtalk syntax highlighting is also 
applied to the Prolog configuration files (*.config).

Some text editors already include support for Logtalk. If that is the 
case of your favorite editor, you may want to check if the supporting 
files provided in this directory are newer than the editor ones.
