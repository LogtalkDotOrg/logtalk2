This directory contains files that provides syntax highlighting, code 
folding, code completion, and auto-indentation for editing Logtalk 
source files with the text editor Vim 7.0 or later version:

	http://www.vim.org/

Recent versions of Vim already contain support for Logtalk. However, 
this directory may contain an updated syntax file. If that is the 
case, install the syntax file by performing the following steps:

1. Copy the file "syntax/logtalk.vim" to the "syntax" sub-directory in 
your VIM installation directory (replacing any existing older file).

2. Add the following entries to the "filetype.vim" configuration file 
(only if not already present):

" Logtalk source files
au BufNewFile,BufRead *.lgt                     setf logtalk

" Logtalk config files
au BufNewFile,BufRead *.config                  setf logtalk

3. Copy the file "indent/logtalk.vim" to the "indent" sub-directory in 
your VIM installation directory (replacing any existing older file).

4. Copy the files "completion/logtalk.dict" and "ftplugin/logtalk.vim" 
to the "ftplugin" sub-directory in your Vim installation directory 
(replacing any existing older files).

5. Add the following lines to your ~/.vimrc file:

	syntax on
	filetype indent on
	filetype plugin on

You may then perform code completion by typing CTRL-X, CTRL-K and then 
CTRL-P or CTRL-N to cycle between all the completion choices.
