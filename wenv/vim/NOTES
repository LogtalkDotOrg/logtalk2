This directory contains a file that provides syntax highlighting 
for editing Logtalk source files with the text editor VIM 6.1 or 
later version (http://www.vim.org).

Recent versions of VIM already contain support for Logtalk. However, 
this directory may contain an updated syntax file. If that is the 
case, install the syntax file by performing the following steps:

1.	Copy the file logtalk.vim to the "syntax" sub-directory in your 
	VIM installation directory.

2.	Add the following entries to the "filetype.vim" configuration 
	file (only if not already present):

" Logtalk source metafiles
au BufNewFile,BufRead *.mlgt                    setf logtalk

" Logtalk source files
au BufNewFile,BufRead *.lgt                     setf logtalk

" Logtalk source file loader
au BufNewFile,BufRead *.loader                  setf logtalk

" Logtalk config files
au BufNewFile,BufRead *.config                  setf logtalk
