================================================================


This directory contains files that provide syntax highlighting and 
other text editing services for writing Logtalk source files (*.lgt) 
with common text editors. By default, Logtalk syntax highlighting may 
also be applied to the Prolog configuration files (*.pl). Support for
some syntax highlighters (used in e.g in wikis, source code browsers, 
and bug trackers) is also provided.

Some text editors already include support for Logtalk. If that is the 
case of your favorite editor, you may want to check if the supporting 
files provided in this directory are newer than the editor ones.

Logtalk source files (including the library entities and the programming
examples) are formatted using tabs (the recommended setting is a tab width
equivalent to 4 spaces); you may set the tab width on the editor preference
panel.

You may notice that support for some text editors, notably for Windows-only 
editors, is rather poor. Proper syntax highlighting support for Prolog and 
Logtalk requires support for regular expressions with zero-width look-ahead 
and look-behind assertions, which some editors lack.

Some text editors supporting regular expressions contain bugs and/or 
hard-coded limitations that prevent full optimization of the syntax 
coloring patterns.

As Logtalk can be viewed as a superset of ISO Prolog, you may also use 
the resources in this directory for editing plain Prolog source files.
