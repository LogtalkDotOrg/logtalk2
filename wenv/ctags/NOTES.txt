This folder contains minimal support for using Exuberant Ctags 
(http://ctags.sourceforge.net/) with Logtalk. There are two files 
that you will need to rename and copy to your home directory:

	ctags
		Rename this file to "$HOME/.ctags" or append its contents to
		the "$HOME/.ctags" file if it already exists

	ctags.tmcodebrowser
		Rename this file to "$HOME/.ctags.tmcodebrowser" or append its 
		contents to "$HOME/.ctags.tmcodebrowser" if it already exists 
		in order to use the MacOS X TextMate text editor and its 
		TmCodeBrowser plug-in (http://www.cocoabits.com/TmCodeBrowser/)
