This directory contains some files that provide syntax highlighting and 
project and template files for editing Logtalk source files with MacOS X 
Xcode 1.1 or later version.


To install:

1. Copy the files "logtalk.pbfilespec" and "logtalk.pblangspec" to the 
directory:

	~/Library/Application Support/Apple/Developer Tools/Specifications 

2. Copy the directory "Logtalk" to the directory:
 
	~/Library/Application Support/Apple/Developer Tools/File Templates 

3. Create (if it does not exist) the directory:

	~/Library/Application Support/Apple/Developer Tools/Project Templates/Logtalk

and copy to it the directory Logtalk Application


Altough the file logtalk.pblangspec provides simple syntax coloring for the 
Logtalk language, it is recommended that you configure Xcode to use the 
text editor SubEthaEdit as an external editor for editing Logtalk source 
files.


SUPPORT FOR THIS IDE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.
