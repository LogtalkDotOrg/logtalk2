This directory contains the "logtalk.py" file that provides syntax 
coloring support for Pygments (version 0.9 or later):

	http://pygments.org/


This support file is dual-licensed under the Artistic License 2.0 and the 
Pygments license.

In order to check if your Pygments installation already includes support 
for Logtalk, use the following command:

	% pygmentize -H lexer logtalk

If support for Logtalk is not included or if it is outdated, compile the 
file "logtalk.py" into a "logtalk.pyc" byte code file and copy the two 
files into the folder:

	site-packages/pygments/lexers/

Next, rebuild the lexer mappings by typing:

	% python _mapping.py

Logtalk source files (including the programming examples) are usually 
formatted using four-space tabs. This can be specified by using the 
"whitespace" filter option "tabsize":

	$ pygmentize -F whitespace:tabs=True,tabsize=4 -O full,style=friendly -o source.html source.lgt

When your source file uses an encoding other than ASCII or ISO-Latin-1, 
you will need to use the "encoding" option. For example:

	$ pygmentize -F whitespace:tabs=True,tabsize=4 -O encoding=utf8 -o babel.html babel.lgt

As the Pygments syntax highlighting engine itself, the "logtalk.py" file 
is licensed under the BSD license.

You may also use the Logtalk lexer with plain Prolog files by using the "-l" 
option. For example:

	$ pygmentize -l logtalk -F whitespace:tabs=True,tabsize=4 -o source.html source.pl
