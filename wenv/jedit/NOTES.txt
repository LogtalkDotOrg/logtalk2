This directory contains files that provide syntax highlighting, automatic
code indenting, code completion, and programming templates for editing 
Logtalk source files with the text editor jEdit 4.3 or later version:

	http://www.jedit.org/

These support files are dual-licensed under the Artistic License 2.0 and 
the jEdit license.

To install:

1.	Copy the file logtalk.xml to the modes subdirectory of your jEdit 
	installation directory.

2.	Open the "catalog" file in the same subdirectory and add (if not 
	present) the following entry:
	
	<MODE NAME="logtalk" FILE="logtalk.xml" FILE_NAME_GLOB="*.{lgt,config}" />

3.	Install (or update if necessary) the jEdit plug-in Templates 4.0.0
	or later version.

4.	Copy the contents of the subdirectory templates to the templates 
	directory set in the plug-in preferences.

5.	Install the jEdit plug-in CodeBrowser 1.4.2 or later version and the 
	Logtalk support for Exuberant C Tags found on "wenv/ctags" directory.

Notes:

You can use the jEdit code folding indent mode with Logtalk source files.

You can customize the templates for objects, categories, and protocols 
to use your name by default by changing the line that reads:

#prompt ( "Author name:" $authorname )

to:

#prompt ( "Author name:" $authorname "Your Name" )
