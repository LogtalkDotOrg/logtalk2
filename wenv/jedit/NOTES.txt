This directory contains files that provide syntax highlighting and 
programming templates for editing Logtalk source files with the text
editor jEdit 4.1 (http://www.jedit.org).


To install:

1.	Copy the file logtalk.xml to the modes subdirectory of your jEdit 
	installation directory.

2.	Open the "catalog" file in the same subdirectory and add (if not 
	present) the following entry:
	
	<MODE NAME="logtalk" FILE="logtalk.xml" FILE_NAME_GLOB="*.{lgt,config}" />

3.	Install (or update if necessary) the jEdit plug-in Templates 3.0.1
	or later version.

4.	Copy the contents of the subdirectory templates to the templates 
	directory set in the plug-in preferences.


Notes:

You should be able to use jEdit code folding indent mode with Logtalk 
source files.

You can customize the templates for objects, categories, and protocols 
to use your name by default by changing the line that reads:

#prompt ( "Author name:" $authorname )

to:

#prompt ( "Author name:" $authorname "Your Name" )
