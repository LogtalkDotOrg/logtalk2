This directory contains files that provide syntax highlighting and 
programming templates for editing Logtalk source files with the text
editor jEdit 4.1 (http://www.jedit.org).


To install:

1.	Copy the file logtalk.xml to the modes subdirectory of your jEdit 
	installation directory.

2.	Open the "catalog" file in the same subdirectory and add (if not 
	present) the following entry:
	
	<MODE NAME="logtalk" FILE="logtalk.xml" FILE_NAME_GLOB="*.{mlgt,lgt,loader,config}" />

3.	Install (or update if necessary) the jEdit plug-in Templates 3.0.1
	or later version.

4.	Copy the contents of the subdirectory templates to the templates 
	directory set in the plug-in preferences.


Note:

You can customize the templates for objects, categories, and protocols 
to use your name by default by changing the line that reads:

#prompt ( "Author name:" $authorname )

to:

#prompt ( "Author name:" $authorname "Your Name" )
