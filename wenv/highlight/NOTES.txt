This directory contains files that provide support for using version 2.6.9 
or later of the Highlight package by Andre Simon with Logtalk source files.
A detailed description on the Highlight package is available from:

	http://www.andre-simon.de/

In order to check if your Highlight installation already includes support 
for Logtalk, you may use the following command:

	% highlight --list-langs

Look in the resulting listing for the "lgt" extension. If support for Logtalk 
is not included or if it is outdated, copy the file "lgt.lang" to the folder:

	$prefix/share/highlight/langDefs/

where $prefix is the Highlight installation directory (by default, /usr).

Usage example for a "foo.lgt" Logtalk source file:

	% highlight --replace-tabs=4 --xhtml --input=foo.lgt --output=foo.html --style=kwrite

You should try different style files (using the --style option) in order to 
find which ones provide the more satisfactory results. As Logtalk files are 
usually formatted using four-space tabs, the option "--replace-tabs=4" is 
necessary to keep you source code properly formatted.

You may also use the "lgt.lang" file with plain Prolog files by using the 
"--syntax" option. For example:

	% highlight --syntax=lgt --xhtml --input=foo.pl --output=foo.html

THIS SYNTAX COLORING FILE IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT.
