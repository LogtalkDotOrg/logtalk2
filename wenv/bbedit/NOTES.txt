This directory contains files that provide basic syntax highlighting 
for editing Logtalk source files with the Bare Bones BBEdit 8.x or 
TextWrangler 2.x text editors:

	http://www.barebones.com/

To install copy the file "logtalk.plist" either to the folders:

	~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Language Modules/
	~/Library/Application Support/TextWrangler/Language Modules/

or to the folders:

	/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Language Modules/
	/Library/Application Support/TextWrangler/Language Modules/

(create the folder if it does not exist).

Logtalk source files (including the programming examples) are usually 
formatted using four-space tabs; you may set the tab width on the 
editor preference panel.


THESE SYNTAX COLORING SUPPORT FILES ARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT.
