This directory contains files that provide support for using version 3.0.83 
or later of the SyntaxHighlighter package by Alex Gorbatchev with Logtalk 
source files. A detailed description on the SyntaxHighlighter package is 
available from:

	http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/

These support files are dual-licensed under the Artistic License 2.0 
and the SyntaxHighlighter license.

In order to check if your SyntaxHighlighter distribution already includes 
support for Logtalk, look for a file named "shBrushLogtalk.js" in the
"scripts" folder. If support for Logtalk is not included or if it is
outdated, copy the file "shBrushLogtalk.js" to the "scripts" folder.

The file "source.html" is a test file based on the "../tests/source.lgt"
file. In order to use this test file, copy the referenced SyntaxHighlighter
files ("shCore.js", "shCore.css", and "shThemeEclipse.css") to the same
directory and open it in your favorite web browser.
