This directory contains files that provide support for code folding and 
syntax highlighting for editing Logtalk source files with the KDE Kate 
and KWrite text editors (http://kate.kde.org/) and with the KDevelop IDE 
(http://www.kdevelop.org/).

These support files are dual-licensed under the Artistic License 2.0 and 
the KDE license.

To install copy the file "logtalk.xml" to the directory:

    $KDEDIR/share/apps/katepart/syntax/

or:
    
    ~/.kde/share/apps/katepart/syntax/

and restart Kate and KWrite. Logtalk source files (including the programming 
examples) are usually formatted using four-space tabs; you may set the tab 
width on the editor preference panel.
