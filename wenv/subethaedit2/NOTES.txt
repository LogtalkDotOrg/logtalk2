This directory contains the Logtalk.mode bundle that provides syntax 
highlighting for editing Logtalk source files with the SubEthaEdit 2.x 
text editor (http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/).


To install copy the bundle "Logtalk.mode" to one of the following 
folders:

	~/Library/Application Support/SubEthaEdit/Modes/
	/Library/Application Support/SubEthaEdit/Modes/
	/Network/Library/Application Support/SubEthaEdit/Modes/

(create the chosen folder if it does not exist).

Logtalk source files (including the programming examples) are usually 
formatted using four-spaces tabs; you may set the tab width on the 
editor preference panel.
