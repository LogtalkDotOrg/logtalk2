Kod is a free MacOS X text editor available from:

Kod already includes support for syntax highlight of Logtalk source files.
The syntax highlighting support uses GNU Syntax Highlight, which is also
supported by Logtalk. In order to check if Kod built-in support for Logtalk
is out-of-date, control-click on the Kod application icon, select the "Show
Package Contents" menu item, and compare the modification date of the
"Contents/Resources/lang/logtalk.lang" file with the GNU Syntax Highlight
"logtalk.lang" distributed with Logtalk. Be aware that Kod adds a header to
the "*.lang" files that you must preserve when updating. In the Kod 0.0.2
beta version this header is:

# @title Logtalk
# @matchuti public.logtalk-source
# @matchext lgt
