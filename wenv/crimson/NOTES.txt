This directory contains files that provides basic syntax coloring 
for editing Logtalk source files with Crimson Editor V3.60 or later 
version:

	http://www.crimsoneditor.com/

To install these files do the following:

1. Copy the files extension.lgt, extension.loader, and extension.config 
to the "link" folder on the Crimson installation directory.

2. Copy the files logtalk.key and logtalk.spc to the "spec" folder on 
the Crimson installation directory.

Note: The Crimson installation directory is usually:

	C:\Program Files\Crimson Editor

Logtalk source files (including the programming examples) are usually 
formatted using four-space tabs; you may set the tab width on the 
editor preference panel.


THESE SYNTAX COLORING SUPPORT FILES ARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT.
