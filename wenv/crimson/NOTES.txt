This directory contains files that provides basic syntax coloring 
for editing Logtalk source files with Crimson Editor V3.60 or later 
version:

	http://www.crimsoneditor.com/

To install these files do the following:

1. Copy the files extension.lgt, extension.loader, and extension.config 
to the "link" folder on the Crimson installation directory.

2. Copy the files logtalk.key and logtalk.spc to the "spec" folder on 
the Crimson installation directory.

Note: The Crimson installation directory is usually:

	C:\Program Files\Crimson Editor

Logtalk source files (including the library entities and the programming
examples) are formatted using tabs (the recommended setting is a tab width
equivalent to 4 spaces); you may set the tab width on the editor preference
panel.


THESE SYNTAX COLORING SUPPORT FILES ARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT.
