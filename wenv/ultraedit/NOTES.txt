This directory contains files that provides basic syntax coloring,
code folding, and entity list for editing Logtalk source files with
the UltraEdit text editor:

	http://www.ultraedit.com/

To install copy the file "logtalk.uew" to the user "wordfiles" folder.
The default location of this folder depends on the operating-system:

	MacOS X:	~/Library/Application Support/UltraEdit
	Windows:	%appdata%\IDMComp\UltraEdit\wordfiles
	Linux:		~/.idm/uex

Make sure the "logtalk.uew" file uses DOS line terminators (CR/LF). You
can use UltraEdit itself to convert the file to DOS line terminators if
necessary.
