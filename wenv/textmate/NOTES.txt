This directory contains the Logtalk.tmbundle bundle, which provides code 
folding, code completion, syntax coloring, entity index, auto-indentation, 
and snippets of code for editing Logtalk source files with the TextMate 1.x 
text editor:

To install copy the bundle "Logtalk.tmbundle" to one of the following 
folders:

	~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles/
	/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles/

(create the chosen folder if it does not exist).

In order to use the Logtalk bundle commands to compile and automatically 
generate (X)HTML documentation for the frontmost source file window, open 
the TextMate Preferences window, select the "Advanced" tab, click on the 
"Shell Variables" button and add the following new variables:

LOGTALK_COMMAND
	set to the name of the shell script you use to launch Logtalk 
	followed by the option to run a goal at startup (e.g. "yaplgt -g")
LOGTALK_HTML_COMMAND
	set to the name of the shell script you use to generate the (X)HTML 
	documentation (e.g. lgt2html)
LOGTALK_PDF_COMMAND
	set to the name of the shell script you use to generate the PDF 
	documentation (e.g. lgt2pdf)

Logtalk source files (including the programming examples) are usually 
formatted using four-space tabs; you may set the tab width on the 
editor preference panel.
