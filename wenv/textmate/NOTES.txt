This directory contains the Logtalk.tmbundle bundle, which provides code 
folding, code completion, syntax coloring, entity index, auto-indentation, 
and snippets of code for editing Logtalk source files with the TextMate 1.x 
text editor:

To install copy the bundle "Logtalk.tmbundle" to one of the following 
folders:

	~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles/
	/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles/

(create the chosen folder if it does not exist).

In order to use the Logtalk bundle command that automatically generates 
XHTML documentation for the frontmost source file window, open the TextMate 
Preferences window, select the "Advanced" tab, click on the "Shell Variables"
button and add a new variable, "LOGTALK_COMMAND", set to the name of the 
shell script you use to launch Logtalk (e.g. yaplgt).

Logtalk source files (including the programming examples) are usually 
formatted using four-space tabs; you may set the tab width on the 
editor preference panel.
