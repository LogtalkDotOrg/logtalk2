=================================================================


This directory contains a file that provides basic syntax highlighting 
for editing Logtalk source files with the text editor TextPad 4.5 and 
later versions (http://www.textpad.com).


To install:

	First, copy the file "logtalk.syn" to the TextPad syntax folder and the 
	file "Logtalk.tcl" to the clip library folder (see the preferences pane 
	from within the TextPad application for the folders location). Second, 
	define a new document class for Logtalk source files (whose extension is 
	.lgt) and for Prolog configuration files (whose extension is .config).


THE SYNTAX FILE AND THE CLIP LIBRARY ARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT.
