This directory contains files that provide support for using version 2.0 
or later of the source-highlight package by Lorenzo Bettini with Logtalk 
source files.  A detailed description on the source-highlight package is 
available from:

	http://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/

These support files are dual-licensed under the Artistic License 2.0 
and the source-highlight license.

In order to check if your source-highlight installation already includes 
support for Logtalk, use the following command:

	% source-highlight --lang-list

If support for Logtalk is not included or if it is outdated, copy the file
"logtalk.lang" to the folder:

	$prefix/share/source-highlight

where $prefix is the source-highlight installation directory (by default, 
/usr/local) and then edit, if necessary, the file:

	$prefix/share/source-highlight/lang.map

and add the entry:

	lgt = logtalk.lang

Usage example for a "foo.lgt" Logtalk source file:

	% source-highlight --tab=4 --out-format xhtml --input foo.lgt --output foo.html

Usually, Logtalk files are formatted using four-space tabs. You may want to 
use the "--tab=4"option to keep you source code formatting choices.

You may also use the "logtalk.lang" file with plain Prolog files by using 
the "--src-lang" option. For example:

	% source-highlight --src-lang lgt --out-format xhtml --input foo.pl --output foo.html
