To consult the Logtalk documentation open the file "index.html" with a
web browser.

All manual pages conform to the XHTML 1.0 Strict W3C Standard. You may 
change the appearance of the pages by changing the included "styles.css" 
cascade style sheet file. Needless to say, the manual pages look better 
in recent web browser releases that support both the XHTML 1.0 and CSS 
web standards.
