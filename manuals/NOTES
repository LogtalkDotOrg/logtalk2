=================================================================
Logtalk - Object oriented extension to Prolog
Release 2.27.0

=================================================================

To consult the Logtalk documentation open the file "index.html" with a
web browser.

All manual pages conform to the XHTML 1.1 W3C Standard. You may change 
the appearance of the pages by changing the included "screen.css" 
CSS file. Needless to say, the manual pages look better in recent web 
browser releases that support both the XHTML 1.1 and CSS web standards.

The "print.css" CSS file can be used with CSSToXSLFO (version 1.2 or 
later) to generate PDF files with page numbers suitable for printing. 
For informations on how to use CSSToXSLFO, please see the following 
URL:

	http://www.re.be/css2xslfo/

An usage example would be:

	% java -jar css2xslfo1_2.jar <file>.html -fo <file>.fo
	% xep -fo <file>.fo -pdf <file>.pdf

RenderX's XEP is strongly recommended. Some of the others XSL-FO 
processors do not support some of the used XSL-FO 1.0 constructs.
