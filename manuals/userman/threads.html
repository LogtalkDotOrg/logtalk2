<h1>Multi-threading programming</h1>

<p>
Logtalk supports multi-threading programming on selected Prolog compilers. Logtalk makes use of the low-level Prolog predicates that interface with POSIX threads (or a suitable emulation), providing a high-level set of predicates that allows programmers to easily take advantage of modern multi-processor and multi-core computers without caring about the details of creating, synchronizing, or communicating with threads. Logtalk multi-threading programming integrates with object-oriented programming by allowing the optional creation of per object threads, enabling objects to send and receive asynchronous messages or to call local predicates concurrently.
</p>

<h2>Enabling multi-threading support<a id="enabling"></a></h2>

<p>
Multi-threading support is disabled by default. It must be enabled on the Prolog configuration files of supported compilers by setting the read-only compiler flag <code>threads</code> to <code>on</code>.
</p>

<h2>Object threads<a id="directive"></a></h2>

<p>
In order to automatically create and set up an object's thread the following object directive must be used:
</p>
<pre>:- threaded.</pre>
<p>
The thread is created when the object is loaded or created at runtime. The thread for the pseudo-object <code>user</code> is automatically created when Logtalk is loaded (provided that multi-threading programming is supported and enabled for the chosen Prolog compiler).
</p>

<h2>Multi-threading built-in predicates<a id="predicates"></a></h2>

<p>
Logtalk provides a small set of built-in predicates for running goals in new threads and for retriving goal results. These predicates provide high-level support for multi-threading programming which covers the most common use cases.
</p>

<h3>Proving goals asynchronously using threads<a id="call"></a></h3>

<p>
A goal may be proved asynchronously using a new thread by calling the Logtalk built-in predicate <a title="Consult reference manual" href="../refman/builtins/threaded_call1.html"><code>threaded_call/1</code></a>. The term representing the goal is copied, not shared with the thread. Therefore, any variable bindings resulting from the goal proof must be retrieved by calls to the built-in predicates <a title="Consult reference manual" href="../refman/builtins/threaded_exit1.html"><code>threaded_exit/1</code></a> and <a title="Consult reference manual" href="../refman/builtins/threaded_exit2.html"><code>threaded_exit/2</code></a>.
</p>

<h3>Retriving asynchronous goal proof results<a id="exit"></a></h3>

<p>
The results of proving a goal asynchronously in a new thread may be retrieved by calling the Logtalk built-in predicates <a title="Consult reference manual" href="../refman/builtins/threaded_exit1.html"><code>threaded_exit/1</code></a> and <a title="Consult reference manual" href="../refman/builtins/threaded_exit2.html"><code>threaded_exit/2</code></a> in the same object where the call to the <code>threaded_call/1-2</code> predicate was made.
</p>
<p>
Calls to the <code>threaded_exit/1</code> predicate, and, by default, calls to the <code>threaded_exit/2</code> predicate, block the caller until the object's thread receives the reply to the assynchronous call. The option <code>peek</code> may be used to check if a reply is already avaialble. Using this option, the <code>threaded_exit/2</code> predicate call succeeds or fails immediately without bloking the caller. However, keep in mind that repeated use of this option is equivalent to polling, which may severely hurt performance.
</p>

<h2>One-way asynchronous calls<a id="noreply"></a></h2>

<p>
Sometimes we want to call a goal in a new thread without caring for the results. This may be accomplished by using the built-in predicate <a title="Consult reference manual" href="../refman/builtins/threaded_call2.html"><code>threaded_call/2</code></a> with the option <code>noreply</code>.
</p>

<h2>Atomic goals and asynchronous calls<a id="atomic"></a></h2>

<p>
Proving a goal asynchronously using a new thread may lead to problems when the goal implies side-effects such as input/output operations or modifications to an object's database. For example, if a new thread is started with a similar goal before the first one finished its job, we may end with mixed output or a corrupted database. In these cases, we may call the built-in predicate <a title="Consult reference manual" href="../refman/builtins/threaded_call2.html"><code>threaded_call/2</code></a> using the option <code>atomic</code> in order to ensure that the object which will span the thread for proving the goal argument will not accept any other asynchronous request until the first one terminates.
</p>
