=================================================================
Logtalk - Object oriented extension to Prolog
Release 2.28.0

=================================================================

To consult the Logtalk documentation open the file "index.html" with a
web browser.

All manual pages conform to the XHTML 1.1 W3C Standard. You may change 
the appearance of the pages by changing the included "screen.css" 
CSS file. Needless to say, the manual pages look better in recent web 
browser releases that support both the XHTML 1.1 and CSS web standards.

The "print.css" CSS file can be used with CSSToXSLFO (version 1.3.2 or 
later) to generate PDF files with page numbers suitable for printing. 
For informations on how to use CSSToXSLFO, please see the following 
URL:

	http://www.re.be/css2xslfo/

An usage example (with version 1.3.2) would be:

	% java -jar css2xslfo1_3_2.jar <file>.html -fo <file>.fo
	% fop -fo <file>.fo -pdf <file>.pdf

The latest FOP version is strongly recommended. You may also use other 
XSL-FO processors such as RenderX's Xep.
