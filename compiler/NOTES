=================================================================
Logtalk - Object oriented extension to Prolog
Release 2.21.7

Copyright (c) 1998-2004 Paulo Moura.  All Rights Reserved.
=================================================================

This folder contains a Prolog file, "logtalk.pl", which  implements 
both the Logtalk compiler and the Logtalk runtime, and two template 
files, "libpaths_site_template.pl" and "libpaths_user_template.pl", 
for defining library paths for the Logtalk standard library and for 
all the supplied examples.

Before loading the Logtalk compiler/runtime file into your favorite 
Prolog compiler, you must first load the appropriated configuration 
file that you will find in the "configs" directory.

If you want to compile and load source files using the notation 
<library>(<entity>), copy one the template files to a file named 
"libpaths.pl" and edit it to reflect your Logtalk installation. If 
you have installed Logtalk in a system-wide location, then copy the 
file "libpaths_site_template.pl". If you have make a copy of the 
Logtalk standard library and examples to your home directory using 
the "misc/cplgtdirs.*" shell scripts, then a copy the template file 
"libpaths_user_template.pl" named "libpaths.pl" is already in your 
Logtalk home folder. Load the "libpaths.pl" into your Prolog 
compiler after loading the Logtalk compiler/runtime. Note that a few 
Prolog compilers do not support the <library>(<entity>) notation. 
See the "configs/NOTES" file for details.
