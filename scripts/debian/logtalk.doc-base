Author: Paulo Moura
Abstract: Logtalk documentation.
 Logtalk is an object-oriented logic programming language that can use
 most Prolog implementations as a back-end compiler. As a multi-paradigm
 language, it includes support for both prototypes and classes, protocols
 (interfaces), component-based programming through category-based composition,
 event-driven programming, and high-level multi-threading programming.
