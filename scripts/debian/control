Description: Open source object-oriented logic programming language.
 Logtalk is an open source object-oriented logic programming language 
 that can use most Prolog implementations as a back-end compiler.
 As a multi-paradigm language, Logtalk includes support for both 
 prototypes and classes, protocols (interfaces), component-based
 programming through category-based composition, event-driven
 programming, and high-level multi-threading programming.
