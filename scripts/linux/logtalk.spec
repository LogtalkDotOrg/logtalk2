%description
Logtalk is an open source object-oriented logic programming language that can use most Prolog implementations as a back-end compiler. As a multi-paradigm language, Logtalk includes support for both prototypes and classes, protocols, component-based programming through category-based composition, event-driven programming, and multi-threading programming.
