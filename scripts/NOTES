=================================================================


This directory contains miscellaneous files used in Logtalk packaging, 
installation, and integration with Prolog compilers. Several scripts are 
included. Those with extension .sh are shell scripts for MacOS X, Linux, 
and similar systems. Those with extension .js are JScript command-line 
scripts for Windows; they require WSH 5.6 or later version to be installed
and should be run using cscript.exe from the command line.


lgt_install.sh
	shell script for installing Logtalk in a system-wide location for Unix and 
	Unix-like operating systems (must be run from this directory by a user with 
	administration privileges); accepts as an optional argument a prefix for the 
	installation directory (default is /usr/local)
lgt_install.js
	Windows NT/2000/XP JScript script for completing the Logtalk installation 
	by setting the LOGTALKHOME system environment variable and by creating a 
	new program group named "Logtalk" in the Windows Start Menu (must be run 
	from this directory by a user with administration privileges after 
	decompressing the Logtalk distribution into its final destination; you might
	need to logout and login again in order to use the items in the created 
	"Logtalk" program group due to the definition of a new system environment 
	variable)

logtalk.spec
	specification file for building Linux RPMs
	(copy the Logtalk tarball to your RPM SOURCES directory and then 
	run the command: rpmbuild -ba --target=noarch-*-linux logtalk.spec)

cplgtdirs.sh
cplgtdirs.js
	sample scripts for the copying xml, examples, and library directories to the 
	user home directory (must be run by the end-user to ensure proper permissions 
	on the copied files)

cleandist.sh
	script for cleaning a Logtalk distribution in preparation for 
	packaging.

debian
	directory containing support files for building a Debian package
	(work in progress; not yet functional)


The following scripts must be run by a user with administration privileges:

make_ciaolgt.sh
	makes a shell script named ciaolgt for running Logtalk with CIAO Prolog
	(the first run of the ciaolgt script must be made as root or using sudo)
make_ciaolgt.js
	makes a Windows shortcut named "Logtalk - CIAO" for running Logtalk with 
	CIAO 1.10 (the first call to the shortcut must be made by a user with 
	administrative rights)

make_eclipselgt.sh
	makes a shell script named eclipselgt for running Logtalk with ECLiPSe
make_eclipselgt.js
	makes a Windows shortcut named "Logtalk - ECLiPSe" for running Logtalk 
	with ECLiPSe 5.7 (if you are using a different version, you must edit 
	the reference to the registry key in the script; if you prefer to use
	TkEclipse, open the %LOGTALKHOME%\bin\logtalkeclipse.pl file with it)

make_gplgt.sh
	makes a shell script named gplgt for running Logtalk with GNU Prolog
make_gplgt.js
	makes a Windows shortcut named "Logtalk - GNU Prolog" for running Logtalk 
	with GNU Prolog
make_gplgt_exe.js
	makes a new GNU Prolog top level named gplgt.exe and creates a Windows 
	shortcut named "Logtalk - GNU Prolog" for running it (needs the developer 
	tools nasm.exe and cp.exe installed; both the developer tools and the GNU 
	Prolog installation bin directory must be in the system path)

make_qplgt.sh
	makes a shell script named qplgt for running Logtalk with Qu-Prolog 
	(based on script code contributed by Peter Robinson)

make_sicstuslgt.sh
	makes a shell script named sicstuslgt for running Logtalk with SICStus 
	Prolog
make_sicstuslgt.js
	makes a Windows shortcut named "Logtalk - SICStus Prolog" for running 
	Logtalk with SICStus Prolog 3.11 (if you are using a different version, 
	you must edit the reference to the registry key in the script)

make_swilgt.sh
	makes a shell script named swilgt for running Logtalk with SWI-Prolog
make_swilgt.js
	makes a Windows shortcut named "Logtalk - SWI-Prolog" for running Logtalk 
	with SWI-Prolog

make_yaplgt.sh
	makes a shell script named yaplgt for running Logtalk with YAP
make_yaplgt.js
	makes a Windows shortcut named "Logtalk - YAP" for running Logtalk with YAP
	(assumes that the Yap folder is installed in C:\Program Files; edit the path 
	to the yap.exe executable in the script if necessary)

make_xsblgt.sh
	makes a shell script named xsblgt for running Logtalk with XSB

These scripts require the environment variable LOGTALKHOME (pointing to the 
Logtalk installation directory) to be defined. In addition, the shell scripts 
accept as an optional argument a prefix for the location of a link to the 
scripts (default is /usr/local, creating the links in /usr/local/bin). Please 
note that the environment variable LOGTALKHOME must be defined in order to run 
the *lgt scripts that are created by the shell scripts above or the Windows 
shortcuts (see the INSTALL file for details on setting the variable).

Note: when Logtalk is manually installed from sources, the shell scripts might 
not have the executable permission bit set. In that case it will be necessary 
to first run the command "chmod a+x *.sh" on the scripts directory.
