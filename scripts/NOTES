=================================================================


This directory contains miscellaneous files used in Logtalk packaging, 
installation, and integration with Prolog compilers:

lgt_install.sh
	shell script for installing Logtalk in Unix and Unix-like operating 
	systems (must be runned from this directory by a user with administration 
	privileges); accepts as an optional argument a prefix for the installation 
	directory (default is /usr/local)

logtalk.spec
	specification file for building Linux RPMs
	(copy the Logtalk tarball to your RPM SOURCES directory and then 
	run the command: rpmbuild -ba --target=noarch-*-linux logtalk.spec)

cplgtdirs.sh
	shell script for copying xml, examples and library directories to 
	the user home directory (must be runned by the end-user to ensure 
	proper permissions on the copied files)


The following shell scripts must be runned by a user with administration 
privileges:

make_eclipselgt.sh
	makes a script named eclipselgt for running Logtalk with ECLiPSe

make_gplgt.sh
	makes a script named gplgt for running Logtalk with GNU Prolog

make_qplgt.sh
	makes a script named qplgt for running Logtalk with Qu-Prolog 
	(based on script code contributed by Peter Robinson)

make_sicstuslgt.sh
	makes a script named sicstuslgt for running Logtalk with SICStus Prolog

make_swilgt.sh
	makes a script named swilgt for running Logtalk with SWI-Prolog

make_yaplgt.sh
	makes a script named yaplgt for running Logtalk with YAP

These scripts require the environment variable LOGTALKHOME (containing the 
Logtalk installation directory) to be defined. In addition, they accept as 
an optional argument a prefix for the location of a link to the scripts 
(default is /usr/local, creating the links in /usr/local/bin). Please note 
that the environment variable LOGTALKHOME must be defined in order to run 
the *lgt scripts that are created by the shell scripts above.

Note: when Logtalk is manually installed from sources, the shell scripts might 
not have the executable permission bit set. In that case it will be necessary 
to first run the command "chmod a+x *.sh".
