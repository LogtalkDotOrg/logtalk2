================================================================


This directory contains several shell scripts used for Logtalk packaging, 
installation, and integration with Prolog compilers. Those with extension 
".sh" are Bourne-compatible shells scripts for MacOS X, Linux, and similar 
systems. Those with extension ".js" are JScript command-line scripts for 
Windows; they require WSH 5.6 or later version to be installed and should 
be run using cscript.exe from a DOS command line shell (you may download 
WSH 5.6 from http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/list/webdev.asp).

build_release.sh
	helper script for building most of the distribution files of a new 
	Logtalk release

cleandist.sh
	script for cleaning a Logtalk distribution in preparation for packaging

install.sh
	shell script for installing Logtalk in a system-wide location for Unix 
	and Unix-like operating systems (must be run from this directory by a 
	user with administration privileges; accepts as an optional argument 
	a prefix for the installation directory: default is "/opt/local" on 
	Darwin and "/usr/local" on other POSIX systems, resulting in Logtalk 
	being installed in "$prefix/share" with useful scripts written to 
	"$prefix/bin", which should be your path)
uninstall.sh
	shell script for de-installing Logtalk in Unix and Unix-like operating 
	systems (must be run from this directory by a user with administration 
	privileges)

debian
	directory containing support files for building a Debian package
	(work in progress; experimental)

linux
	directory containing files used when building

macosx
	directory containing files used when building MacOS X installer 
	packages

windows
	directory containing files used when building Windows 2000/XP GUI 
	installers

cplgtdirs.sh
cplgtdirs.js
	end-user scripts for copying the Logtalk user-modifiable files and 
	directories to the location pointed by the environment variable 
	LOGTALKUSER (defaults to "~/logtalk" on POSIX operating-systems 
	and to "My Documents\Logtalk" on Windows when the variable is not 
	defined); must be run by the end-user in order to ensure proper 
	permissions for the copied files; the LOGTALKHOME environment 
	variable must be defined (pointing to the Logtalk installation 
	directory)

Please note that the environment variables LOGTALKHOME and LOGTALKUSER 
must be defined in order to run the integration scripts created by the 
installer scripts (see the "INSTALL.txt" file for details on setting the 
variables).

All the provided installers automatically create a set of integration 
scripts or shortcuts for easily running Logtalk with several back-end 
Prolog compilers. On POSIX systems, the scripts should be available 
from you path. On Windows systems, the shortcuts are available on the 
"Start Menu/Programs/Logtalk" menu. The integration scripts and shortcuts 
may fail if you use non-standard locations for your Prolog compilers.

The first run of the B-Prolog, Ciao, and XSB integration scripts must be 
made by an user with administrative rights (on POSIX systems, run them 
once as root or using sudo; in Windows systems run them once from an 
administrative account).

Depending on the size and complexity of your Logtalk applications, you 
may need to change the integration scripts in order to allocate more 
memory to the back-end Prolog compilers. Please consult the documentation 
on the Prolog compilers you intend to use for details.
