This directory contains some shell scripts used for Logtalk packaging, 
installation, and integration with Prolog compilers. Those with extension 
".sh" are Bourne-compatible shells scripts for MacOS X, Linux, and similar 
systems. Those with extension ".js" are JScript command-line scripts for 
Windows; they require WSH 5.6 or later version to be installed and should 
be run using cscript.exe from a DOS command line shell (you may download 
WSH 5.6 from http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/list/webdev.asp).

build_release.sh
	helper script for building most of the distribution files of a new 
	Logtalk release

cleandist.sh

install.sh
	shell script for installing Logtalk in a system-wide location for Unix 
	and Unix-like operating systems (must be run from this directory by a 
	user with administration privileges; accepts as an optional argument 
	a prefix for the installation directory: default is "/opt/local" on 
	Darwin, "/usr" on Debian systems, and "/usr/local" on other POSIX 
	systems, resulting in Logtalk being installed in "$prefix/share" with 
	useful scripts written to "$prefix/bin", which should be your path)

uninstall.sh
	shell script for de-installing Logtalk in Unix and Unix-like operating 
	systems (must be run from this directory by a user with administration 
	privileges)

debian
	directory containing support files for building a Debian package
	(work in progress; experimental)

cplgtdirs.sh
cplgtdirs.js
	end-user scripts for copying the Logtalk user-modifiable files and 
	directories to the location pointed by the environment variable 
	LOGTALKUSER (defaults to "~/logtalk" on POSIX operating-systems 
	and to "My Documents\Logtalk" on Windows when the variable is not 
	defined); must be run by the end-user in order to ensure proper 
	permissions for the copied files; the LOGTALKHOME environment 
	variable must be defined (pointing to the Logtalk installation 
	directory)
