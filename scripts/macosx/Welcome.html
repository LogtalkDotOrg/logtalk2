<b>Welcome to the Logtalk for Mac OS X Installer</b>
</p>
<p>
Logtalk is an open source object-oriented logic programming language that can use most Prolog implementations as a back-end compiler. As a multi-paradigm language, Logtalk includes support for both prototypes and classes, protocols, component-based programming through category-based composition, event-driven programming, and multi-threading programming.

<p>
This installer guides you through the steps necessary to install Logtalk for Mac OS X. Logtalk is installed on the <b>/opt/local/share/logtalk</b> directory. After completing the installation, each Logtalk end-user must run the shell command <b>cplgtdirs</b> once before using the Prolog integration scripts. This command creates a folder named <b>logtalk</b> on the user's home directory containing configuration files, examples, and documentation. Inside this folder is a link to a <b>CUSTOMIZE.txt</b> file describes how to customize Logtalk for your personal use. Links to the Prolog integration scripts are created on the <b>/opt/local/bin</b> directory, which must be on your system path. The integration scripts are described on the <b>/opt/local/share/logtalk/integration/NOTES.txt</b> file.
</p>
<p>
A link to the Logtalk installation folder is automatically created on the Applications folder. To get started, click Continue.
