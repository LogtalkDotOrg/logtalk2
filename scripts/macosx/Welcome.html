<b>Welcome to the Logtalk for Mac OS X Installer</b>
</p>
<p>
Logtalk is an open source object-oriented logic programming language that can use most Prolog implementations as a back-end compiler. As a multi-paradigm language, it includes support for both prototypes and classes, protocols (interfaces), component-based programming through category-based composition, event-driven programming, and high-level multi-threading programming.
</p>
<p>
Logtalk <b>requires</b> a compatible Prolog compiler to be installed in order to run.
</p>
<p>
This installer guides you through the steps necessary to install Logtalk for Mac OS X. Logtalk is installed on the <b>/opt/local/share/logtalk</b> directory. A link to this directory is automatically created on the <b>/Applications</b> directory. Links to the Prolog integration scripts are created on the <b>/opt/local/bin</b> directory, which must be on your system path.
</p>
<p>
After installation, each Logtalk user should run the shell command <b>logtalk_user_setup</b>, which creates a <b>logtalk</b> directory on the user's home directory containing library files, examples, and documentation.
