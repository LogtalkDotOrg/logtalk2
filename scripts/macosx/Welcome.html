<b>Welcome to the Logtalk for Mac OS X Installer</b>
</p>
<p>
Logtalk is an open source object-oriented logic programming language that can use most Prolog implementations as a back-end compiler. As a multi-paradigm language, it includes support for both prototypes and classes, protocols (interfaces), component-based programming through category-based composition, event-driven programming, and high-level multi-threading programming.
</p>
<p>
Logtalk <b>requires</b> at least one compatible Prolog compiler to be properly installed in order to run.
</p>
<p>
This installer guides you through the steps necessary to install Logtalk for Mac OS X. Logtalk is installed on the <b>/opt/local/share/logtalk</b> directory. A link to this directory is automatically created on the <b>/Applications</b> directory. After completing the installation, each Logtalk end-user must run the shell command <b>cplgtdirs</b> once before using the Prolog integration scripts. This command creates a directory named <b>logtalk</b> on the user's home directory containing library files, examples, and documentation. Inside this directory is a link to a <b>CUSTOMIZE.txt</b> file describes how to customize Logtalk for your personal use. Links to the Prolog integration scripts are created on the <b>/opt/local/bin</b> directory, which must be on your system path. See the <b>/Applications/Logtalk/QUICK_START.txt</b> file for instructions on how to run Logtalk.
