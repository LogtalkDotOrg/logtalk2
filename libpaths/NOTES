Logtalk - Object oriented extension to Prolog
Release 2.22.2

Copyright (c) 1998-2004 Paulo Moura.  All Rights Reserved.
=================================================================

This folder contains a Prolog file, "libpaths.pl", which defines the 
library paths for the Logtalk standard library and for all the supplied 
examples.

In order to easily compile and load library and example source files 
using the notation <library>(<entity>), you will need to load the 
"libpaths.pl" into your Prolog compiler after loading the Logtalk 
compiler/runtime. You might need to edit the "libpaths.pl" file in 
order to adapt it to reflect your Logtalk installation and your Prolog 
compiler and operating-system requirements. As defined, the provided 
"libpaths.pl" file is already compatible with some of the most popular 
Prolog compilers, running on both on Windows, Unix, and Unix-like 
operating-systems. The Prolog integration scripts found on the "misc" 
directory generate scripts and shortcuts that automatically load the 
copy of the "libpaths.pl" file from the Logtalk end-user directory 
created by the "misc/cplgtdirs.*" scripts. See the "INSTALL" and the 
"misc/NOTES" files for more details. Note that a few Prolog compilers 
do not support the <library>(<entity>) notation. See the "configs/NOTES" 
file for details.
