Logtalk - Object oriented extension to Prolog
Release 2.22.0

Copyright (c) 1998-2004 Paulo Moura.  All Rights Reserved.
=================================================================

This folder contains a Prolog file, "libpaths.pl", which defines the 
library paths for the Logtalk standard library and for all the supplied examples.

In order to easily compile and load library and example source files 
using the notation <library>(<entity>), you need to copy one the 
library paths template files to a file named "libpaths.pl", edit it 
to reflect your Logtalk installation, and then compile and load it. 
If you have installed Logtalk in a system-wide location, then copy 
the file "libpaths_site_template.pl". If you have make a copy of the 
Logtalk standard library and examples to your home directory using 
the "misc/cplgtdirs.*" shell scripts, then a copy the template file 
"libpaths_user_template.pl" named "libpaths.pl" is already in your 
Logtalk home folder (~/logtalk). Load the "libpaths.pl" into your 
Prolog compiler after loading the Logtalk compiler/runtime. Note 
that a few Prolog compilers do not support the <library>(<entity>) 
notation. See the "configs/NOTES" file for details.
