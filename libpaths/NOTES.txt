================================================================


This folder contains a Prolog file, "libpaths.pl" file, that when loaded
defines the library paths for the Logtalk standard library and for all
the supplied examples. You may customize this file by adding the paths
to your own "libraries" in order to easily load your own source code.

In order to easily compile and load library and example source files using 
the notation <library>(<entity>), you will need to load the "libpaths.pl" 
into your Prolog compiler after loading the Logtalk compiler/runtime.

You might need to edit the "libpaths.pl" file in order to adapt it to 
reflect your Logtalk installation, Prolog compiler, and operating-system 
requirements (for example, some Prolog compilers do not accept or expand 
environment variables occurring on paths).

As defined, the provided "libpaths.pl" file is already compatible with 
some of the most popular Prolog compilers, running on MacOS X, Linux, 
Windows, Unix, and Unix-like operating-systems.

The Prolog integration scripts, found on the "integration" directory,
automatically load the copy of the "libpaths.pl" file from the Logtalk 
end-user directory created by the "scripts/cplgtdirs.*" scripts. See the 
"INSTALL.txt" and "scripts/NOTES.txt" files for more details. Note that 
some Prolog compilers do not support the <library>(<entity>) notation. 
See the "configs/NOTES.txt" file for details.
