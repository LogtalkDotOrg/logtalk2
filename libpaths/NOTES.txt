================================================================


This folder contains two Prolog files, "libpaths_no_multifile.pl" and
"libpaths.pl". The first file is only used by back-end Prolog compilers
that don't support the ISO Prolog standard predicate directive multifile/1
(e.g. GNU Prolog). The documentation that follows applies to both files.

The "libpaths.pl" file, when loaded, defines the library paths for the
Logtalk standard library and for all the supplied examples. You may
customize this file by adding the paths to your own "libraries" in order
to easily load your own source code.

In order to easily compile and load library and example source files using 
the notation <library>(<entity>), you will need to load the "libpaths.pl" 
into your Prolog compiler after loading the Logtalk compiler/runtime.

You might need to edit the "libpaths.pl" file in order to adapt it to 
reflect your Logtalk installation, Prolog compiler, and operating-system 
requirements (for example, some Prolog compilers do not accept or expand 
environment variables occurring on paths).

As defined, the provided "libpaths.pl" file is already compatible with 
some of the most popular Prolog compilers, running on MacOS X, Linux, 
Windows, Unix, and Unix-like operating-systems.

The Prolog integration scripts, found on the "integration" directory,
automatically load the copy of the "libpaths.pl" file from the Logtalk 
end-user directory created by the "scripts/cplgtdirs.*" scripts. See the 
"INSTALL.txt" and "scripts/NOTES.txt" files for more details. Note that 
some Prolog compilers do not support the <library>(<entity>) notation. 
See the "configs/NOTES.txt" file for details.

Prolog compilers that are expected to be compatible with the provided 
"libpaths.pl" file as is, across operating-systems:

	* B-Prolog
	* Ciao
	* CxProlog
	* ECLiPSe
	* GNU-Prolog
	* K-Prolog
	* Qu-Prolog
	* SICStus Prolog
	* SWI-Prolog
	* YAP
	* XSB

Prolog compilers that imply editing the provided "libpaths.pl" file due 
to the lack of support for expanding environment variables on paths (just 
replace the environment variable LOGTALKUSER by the actual path to your 
Logtalk user folder):

	* Amzi! Prolog
	* IF/Prolog
	* JIProlog
	* Quintus Prolog

Feedback on other Prolog compilers is most appreciated.
