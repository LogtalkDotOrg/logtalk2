================================================================


This folder contains a Prolog file, "libpaths.pl" file, that when loaded
defines the library paths for the Logtalk standard library and for all
the supplied examples.

The Prolog integration scripts and shortcuts automatically load the copy
of the "libpaths.pl" file from the Logtalk user directory created by the
"scripts/logtalk_user_setup.*" scripts. For more details, see the files
"INSTALL.txt" and "scripts/NOTES.txt".

You might need to edit the "libpaths.pl" file in order to adapt it to 
reflect your Logtalk installation, Prolog compiler, and operating-system 
requirements.

As defined, the provided "libpaths.pl" file is already compatible with 
the supported back-end Prolog compilers running on MacOS X, Windows,
Linux, Unix, and Unix-like operating-systems.

Although you may customize this file by adding the paths to your own
"libraries" (in order to easily load your own source code), this is
preferably accomplished by customizing the settings file in the Logtalk
user directory.

When manually loading Logtalk (instead of using the provided integration
scripts and shortcuts), you will need to load the "libpaths.pl" into your
Prolog compiler after loading the Logtalk compiler/runtime in order to
easily compile and load library and example source files using the notation
<library>(<entity>).
