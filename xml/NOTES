This folder contains several files that enables .xml documentation files 
created when compiling objects, categories, or protocols, to be viewed 
in a web browser that supports the W3C standards XML, XSLT, CSS and HTML 4
or to be converted to LateX for printing.

You will need to either copy your .xml files to this directory or copy
these files to the directory where the .xml files reside. The links to 
the .xsl files on the .xml files and the links to the .css files in the 
generated .html files assume that all files reside in the same directory.

The choice of the default .xsl file to use is made in the config files by 
the lgt_default_compiler_option/2 predicate. You can also choose a different 
.xsl file by using the xsl/1 compiler option in the logtalk_compile/2 or 
logtalk_load/2 calls. The default file is lgtxml.xsl (described below).


lgthtml.xsl

	XSLT file to output HTML files from the .xml files. The links in the
	generated HTML files point to related HTML files. It can be used
	to batch convert XML files to HTML files.


lgtxml.xsl

	XSLT file for viewing .xml files directly in in a browser such as Mozilla 
	(version 0.9.2 or later) or Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 for Windows 
	(after installing the latest Microsoft XML Parser Release that is needed 
	for XSL standard compliance). The links in the (internally generated) 
	HTML files point to related XML files.


texml.xsl

	XSLT file to output TeXML files that can be further processed by  
	TeXMLatte to produce LaTeX files. The TeXMLatte program can be found 
	at: http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/texml/.


ie5.xsl

	XSLT file for viewing .xml files in Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.x 
	(works with both Macintosh and Windows versions). The links in the
	(internally generated) HTML files point to related XML files. It can 
	be used to browse and view the XML files directly.


logtalk.dtd

	Document type description describing the structure of the .xml files
	generated by Logtalk.
	

logtalk.xsd

	XML Schema describing the structure of the .xml files generated by 
	Logtalk.


logtalk.css

	Cascade style sheet file to render the HTML output of the .xsl files
	in a web browser.


script.sh

	Sample unix shell script to batch convert .xml files to .html files.
	Edit the file to match your environment.


script.bat

	Sample dos batch script to convert .xml files to .html files.
	Edit the file to match your environment.


Note that you can write other XSLT files for converting the XML files to 
other formats besides HTML or LaTeX. You can also write alternative CSS 
and XSLT files to change the appearance of the HTML and LaTeX files.
