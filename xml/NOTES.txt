This folder contains supporting files for converting and/or indexing XML 
documentation files (which are created when compiling objects, categories, 
or protocols) to PDF files or (X)HTML files using XSL style sheets. The 
documentation files may also be viewed directly on a web browser that 
supports the W3C standards XML, XSLT, CSS, and HTML 4 or XHTML 1.0.

The shell and command-line scripts should be called from the directory 
containing the XML documenting files that you wish to convert. See the 
description of each script below for details.

MAKE SURE THAT THE XSL PROCESSORS YOU INTEND TO USE ARE PROPERLY INSTALLED 
AND WORKING BEFORE RUNNING THESE SCRIPTS!

Regarding conversion to (X)HTML, the links to the XSL files on the XML 
files and the links to the CSS files in the generated HTML files assume 
that all files reside in the same directory.

The choice of the default XSL file to use is made in the config files by 
the '$lgt_default_flag'/2 predicate. You may also choose a different XSL 
file by using the xslfile/1 compiler flag in the logtalk_compile/2 or 
logtalk_load/2 calls. The default file is "lgtxml.xsl" (described below).

The documenting files can be generated either as standalone XML files 
or contain a reference to either the Logtalk DTD file, "logtalk.dtd", 
or to the Logtalk XML Schema file, "logtalk.xsd". The reference to the 
XML specification file can be either a local reference or a URI reference.
By default, all XML documenting files contain a local reference but that 
can be changed either in the config files, by setting a Logtalk compiler 
flag, or by using the xmlsref/1 compiler flag. Choose the option value 
that works best with your XSLT tools. To choose between the DTD or XSD 
specifications use the xmlspec/1 compiler flag.

As Logtalk uses a single namespace for all objects, categories, and protocols,
you may want to define an alternate, global compilation directory to store all 
the XML documenting files, thus ensuring proper working of links to other 
entities in the generated (X)HTML files. This can be easily accomplished by 
using the predicate '$lgt_default_flag'/2, which is defined on the config 
files. For example:

	'$lgt_default_flag'(xmldir, 'xml_docs/').
	...
	'$lgt_default_flag'(altdirs, on).
	...


Brief description of each file in this folder:


lgtxml.xsl

	XSLT file for viewing XML files directly in a browser. The links 
	in the (internally generated) HTML 4.01 files point to related XML 
	files. UTF-8 encoding is assumed. Edit the file if you use a different 
	encoding.


lgthtml.xsl

	XSLT file to output HTML 4.01 files from the XML files. The links in 
	the generated HTML files point to related HTML files. It can be used 
	to batch convert XML files to HTML files. UTF-8 encoding is assumed.
	Edit the file if you use a different encoding.


lgtxhtml.xsl

	XSLT file to output XHTML 1.1 files from the XML files. The links in 
	the generated XHTML files point to related XHTML files. It can be used 
	to batch convert XML files to XHTML files. UTF-8 encoding is assumed. 
	Edit the file if you use a different encoding.

lgttxt.xsl

	XSLT file to output simple text files from the XML files. UTF-8 encoding 
	is assumed. Edit the file if you use a different encoding.

lgtpdf.xsl
lgtpdfa4.xsl
lgtpdfus.xsl

	XSLT files to generate PDF files from the XML files (formatted either 
	for A4 paper or US Letter paper) using XSL Formatting Objects. Tested 
	with the XSL-FO processors RenderX 4.4 (http://www.renderx.com/) and 
	Apache FOP 0.94 (http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/).

	The "lgtpdf.xsl" file defines a parameter for the paper format (either 
	A4 or US Letter). The files "lgtpdfa4.xsl" and "lgtpdfus.xsl" import the
	"lgtpdf.xsl" file and set the paper format parameter to the appropriate 
	value.


ie50.xsl

	XSLT file for viewing XML files in Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.x 
	(using the outdated Microsoft XML Parser; works with both Macintosh 
	and Windows versions). The links in the (internally generated) HTML 
	files point to related XML files. It can be used to browse and view 
	the XML files directly.


logtalk.dtd

	DTD file describing the structure of the XML files generated by 
	Logtalk.
	

custom.ent

	Document type description defining XML entities for personal data 
	that may be used on Logtalk documenting directives.


logtalk.rng

	RELAX NG file describing the structure of the XML files generated 
	by Logtalk.


logtalk.xsd

	XML Schema file describing the structure of the XML files generated 
	by Logtalk.


logtalk.css

	Cascade style sheet file to render the HTML/XHTML output of the XSL 
	files in a web browser.


lgt2pdf.sh
	(bash shell script)
lgt2pdf.js
	(JScript command-line script for Windows; requires WSH 5.6 or later 
	version)

	Sample scripts to batch convert XML files to PDF files

	Supported XSL-FO processors:
		* Apache FOP processor (tested with version 0.94)
			http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/

	variables are defined and that the chosen XSL-FO processor is available 
	in the path.

	The scripts should be called from the directory containing the XML

	lgt2pdf.js help" or "lgt2pdf.sh -h"; depending on your Logtalk 
	installation, you may simply need to type "lgt2pdf" in order to run 
	the script).

lgt2html.js
	(JScript command-line script for Windows; requires WSH 5.6 or 
	later version)

	Sample scripts to batch convert XML files to HTML files. These 
	scripts also generate an "index.html" file which contains links 
	to all the converted files.
	
	Supported XSLT processors:
		* libxslt (tested with version 1.1.8)
			http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/

	variables are defined and that the chosen XSLT processor is available in 
	the path.

	The scripts should be called from the directory containing the XML files 
	you wish to convert. Call the scripts with the help option for a description 
	of the available optional parameters (type "cscript lgt2html.js help" or

lgt2xml.js
	(JScript command-line script for Windows; requires WSH 5.6 or 
	later version)

	Sample scripts for indexing the XML files in the current directory 
	by generating an "index.html" file which contains links to all the 
	files. In addition, these scripts also copies of the "lgtxml.xsl" 
	and "logtalk.css" files to the current directory, allowing direct 
	visualization of the XML files on a supported web browser.

	These scripts assumes that the LOGTALKHOME and LOGTALKUSER environment 
	variables are defined.

	The scripts should be called from the directory containing the XML files 
	you wish to index. Call the scripts with the help option for a description 
	of the available optional parameters (type "cscript lgt2xml.js help" or

Note that you can write other XSL files for converting the XML files to 
other formats besides PDF or (X)HTML. You can also write alternative CSS 
and XSL files to change the appearance of the (X)HTML and PDF files.
