This folder contains a Logtalk version of John Fletcher's Prolog XML 
parser:

	http://www.binding-time.co.uk/xmlpl.html

To load this XML parser and for sample queries, please see the SCRIPT 
file.

For a detailed description of this XML parser, please see the comments 
in the "xml.lgt" source file or convert the automatically generated 
documentation to HTML or PDF.

See the copyright and license information on the contributed files for 
usage and distributions conditions.

When using GNU Prolog as the back-end compiler, you will need to patch
the "xml.lgt" file. First, find the occurrences of "0''" around lines
723 and 908 and replace them by "0'''". Second, around lines 1783, 1792,
1805, 1808, and 1853 delete the new line character after the double quote
character. You may also need to use a larger default global stack size
(see the GNU Prolog documentation on the environment variable GLOBALSZ).
