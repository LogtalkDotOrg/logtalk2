a short description of each included contribution:

iso8601.lgt
	Contributed by: Daniel L. Dudley	

	This is a partial implementation of the ISO 8601 standard, 
	providing a library of date predicates. The time predicates 
	are not yet implemented. The best way to get acquainted with 
	this library is for you to compile the object and then run 
	one of the documentation helper scripts to transform the 
	resulting XML file into (X)HTML or PDF documentation. Your 
	feedback is appreciated.
