This an experimental example of using attributed variables within Logtalk
objects and categories. It requires the use of a back-end Prolog compiler
with support for attributed variables. Tested with B-Prolog, SWI-Prolog,
XSB, and YAP. The individual example is an adaptation of code found on the
SWI-Prolog documentation.

When using SWI-Prolog or YAP, the "attvars_hook" hook object works by
creating a shadow module (with the same name as the object) containing
the attribute_goals//1 and attr_unify_hook/2 hooks that are required by
the attributed variables implementation. These hooks are compiled as module
multifile predicates in order to avoid spurious compiler warning messages
(note that the hook clause bodies are compiled within the context of the
container object). One limitation of this approach is that we cannot use
parametric objects as the object identifier is used as the name of the
shadow module (module names must be atoms).

When using XSB, the "attvars_hook" hook object works by generating the
install_verify_attribute_handler/4 and install_attribute_portray_hook/3
XSB directives, invoked using Logtalk-compiled arguments. These directives
allows the use of common code for SWI-Prolog, XSB, and YAP. A portability
caveat, however: in XSB, the predicate get_attr/3 throws an exception if
the first argument is not a variable while SWI-Prolog and XSB simply fail
in this case.

When using B-Prolog, the attribute_goals//1 hook grammar rule is discarded.
