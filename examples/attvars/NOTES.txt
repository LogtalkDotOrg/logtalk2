This an experimental example of using attributed variables in Logtalk
objects and categories. It requires the use of a back-end Prolog compiler
with support for attributed variables. Tested with SWI-Prolog, and YAP.
The individual example is an adaptation of code found on the SWI-Prolog
documentation.

The "attvars_hook" hook object works by creating a shadow module (with
the same name as the object) containing the attribute_goals//1 and
attr_unify_hook/2 hooks that are required by the attributed variables
implementation. These hooks are compiled as module multifile predicates
in order to avoid spurious compiler warning messages (note that the hook
clause bodies are compiled within the context of the container object).
One limitation of this approach is that we cannot use parametric objects
as the object identifier is used as the name of the shadow module (module
names must be atoms).
