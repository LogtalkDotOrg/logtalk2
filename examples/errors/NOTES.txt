To load this example, please see the SCRIPT.txt file.

This folder contains examples of objects, categories, and protocols 
containing errors that will trigger Logtalk compiler warnings and 
errors. The goal of this example is to help the user to get acquainted 
to the Logtalk compiler warning and error reporting. Open the object 
source files in a text editor to better understand how the compiler 
deals with common programming errors.

Note that the warnings and errors that you will get while compiling 
your source files depend on your compiler flags (defined explicitly 
as parameters for the logtalk_compile/2 or logtalk_load/2 built-in 
predicates or by default in your Prolog configuration file).
