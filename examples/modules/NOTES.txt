This example illustrates compilation of Prolog module files as objects.

Due to the lack of standardization of Prolog module systems, the module 
files must use only a common subset of Prolog module directives. Consult 
the "Prolog Integration and Migration Guide" in the Logtalk documentation 
for details.
