This an experimental example of using attributed variables within Logtalk
parametric objects and parametric categories. It requires the use of the
"term-attvar" branch of the development version of SWI-Prolog. The individual
examples are adaptations of code found on the SWI-Prolog documentation.

The "attvars_hook" hook object works by creating a shadow module (with the
same name as the functor of the object (or category) identifier containing
the attribute_goals//1-2 and attr_unify_hook/2-3 hooks that are required by
the attributed variables implementation. These hooks are compiled as module
multifile predicates in order to avoid spurious compiler warning messages
(note that the hook clause bodies are compiled within the context of the
container object).
