% start by loading the example:

| ?- logtalk_load(lambdas_compiled(loader)).
...


% the following lambda benchmarks are so far only available when using
% SWI-Prolog, XSB, or YAP as the Logtalk back-end compilers:

?- lambda_benchmarks::bench1.
Using map/2 with a closure for testing less(0, X) with X in [1..100000]: 
% 200,002 inferences, 0.030 CPU in 0.024 seconds (123% CPU, 6666733 Lips)
Using map/2 with a lambda for testing less(0, X) with X in [1..100000]:  
% 300,002 inferences, 0.010 CPU in 0.017 seconds (60% CPU, 30000200 Lips)
true.

?- lambda_benchmarks::bench2.
Adding 1 to every integer in the list [1..100000] using a local add1/2 predicate:
% 100,002 inferences, 0.020 CPU in 0.020 seconds (101% CPU, 5000100 Lips)
Adding 1 to every integer in the list [1..100000] using map/3 with the integer::plus/3 predicate:
% 300,003 inferences, 0.100 CPU in 0.102 seconds (98% CPU, 3000030 Lips)
Adding 1 to every integer in the list [1..100000] using map/3 with a lambda argument with a is/2 goal:
% 200,002 inferences, 0.020 CPU in 0.025 seconds (80% CPU, 10000100 Lips)
true.
