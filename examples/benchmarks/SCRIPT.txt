% start by loading the example by choosing one of the loader files
% (you must quit and restart Logtalk for each testing scenario):


% run benchmarks with event support turned on:

| ?- logtalk_load(benchmarks(loader_events)).
...


% run benchmarks with event support turned off:

| ?- logtalk_load(benchmarks(loader_no_events)).
...


% run benchmarks with event support turned off and using static binding:

| ?- logtalk_load(benchmarks(loader_static_binding)).
...


% list all the benchmark tests:

| ?- benchmarks::benchmark(Id, Goal).

Goal = my_length([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19],_)
Id = s1 ? ;

Goal = object::length([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19],_)
Id = s2 ? ;

Goal = leaf::obj_local
Id = c1 ? ;

Goal = leaf::ctg_direct
Id = c2 ? ;

Goal = leaf::ctg_self
Id = c3 ? ;

Goal = create_object(xpto,[],[],[]),abolish_object(xpto)
Id = d1 ? ;

Goal = plain_dyndb
Id = d2 ? ;

Goal = database::this_dyndb
Id = d3 ? ;

Goal = database::self_dyndb
Id = d4 ? ;

Goal = database::obj_dyndb
Id = d5

yes


% run all the benchmark tests the default number of times:

| ?- benchmarks::run.
...


% or run specific benchmark tests individually, for example:


| ?- benchmarks::run(s1, 1000000).
...
