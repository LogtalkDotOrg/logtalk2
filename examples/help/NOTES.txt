To load this example and for sample queries, please see the SCRIPT 
file.

This example provides basic on-line help for Logtalk when running in
a limited set of operating-systems and back-end Prolog compilers.
Currently, support is limited to:

	Operating-systems:
		Linux, MacOS X, and Windows
	
	Prolog compilers:
		B-Prolog, Ciao Prolog, CxProlog, ECLiPSe, GNU Prolog,
		Qu-Prolog, SICStus Prolog, SWI-Prolog, XSB, and YAP

On Windows, the "start" command must be available. On Linux, the
"xdg-open" command must be available.

The limited support for back-end Prolog compilers is due to the lack
of portable access to the operating-system. This example relies on the
"cc" example to provide a portable operating-system access abstraction.
