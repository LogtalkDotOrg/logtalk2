To load all entities in this example compile and load the loader file:

| ?- logtalk_load(loader).

You will also need to load the following files in the library directory: 
types_loader, events_loader, metapredicates_loader, and dates_loader. 
Alternatively, you may load the library all_loader file to load all 
library entities.

This is a very simple example of the use of events and monitors to make 
profilers for an application. It's easy to modify to make it do much more. 
For instance, most Prolog compilers give you access to data concerning space 
usage (stacks, heap, etc).
