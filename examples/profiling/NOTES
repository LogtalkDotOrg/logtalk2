To load all objects in this example consult the profiling.loader utility
file.

You will also need to load the following files in the library directory: 
types.loader, events.loader, metapredicates.loader, and dates.loader (note 
that the *.loader files are Prolog files). Alternatively, you may load the 
library/all.loader file to load all library entities.


This is a very simple example of the use of events and monitors to make 
profilers for an application. It's easy to modify to make it do much more. 
For instance, most Prolog compilers give you access to data concerning space 
usage (stacks, heap, etc).
