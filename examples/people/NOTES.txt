This example illustrates how to define object constructors for a simple 
hierarchy of objects representing persons, students, and teachers. For
simplicity, prototypes are used instead of classes. Logtalk provides a 
low-level, built-in predicate, create_object/4, for dynamically creating 
new objects. This predicate can be used to define object constructors, 
similar to those used in other OOP languages.

This example also illustrates how to efficiently represent objects with 
immutable state using parametric objects and object proxies (Prolog facts).
