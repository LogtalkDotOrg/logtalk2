To load this example and for sample queries, please see the SCRIPT.txt file.

This folder contains a very simple example of using the compiler option 
hook/1 and the term expansion mechanism to either discard or activate 
debugging goals. For debugging goals in clause bodies, one defines clauses 
for goal_expansion/2. For debugging goals in directives (e.g. in the 
initialization/1 directive), one defines clauses for term_expansion/2.

We can use two hook objects, one for developing and debugging code and
one for production code, or a single parametric object. This example
illustrates both approaches although only the first one is used in the
loader auxiliary files and in the sample queries.
