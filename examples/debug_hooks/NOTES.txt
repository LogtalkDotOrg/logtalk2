To load this example and for sample queries, please see the SCRIPT file.

This folder contains a very simple example of using the compiler option 
hook/1 and the term expansion mechanism to either discard or activate 
debugging goals. For debugging goals in clause bodies, one defines clauses 
for goal_expansion/2. For debugging goals in directives (e.g. in the 
initialization/1 directive), one defines clauses for term_expansion/2.
