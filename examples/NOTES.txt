================================================================


This folder contains several examples of Logtalk programs. A brief 
description of each example is included below.

Each example folder contains a "NOTES.txt" file and a loader helper file 
(usually "loader.lgt") that may be used to load all the example entities. 
Most examples also contain a "SCRIPT.txt" file with instructions on how 
to load the example and sample queries for your to try.

Most of these examples need objects, protocols, and categories that 
are defined in the Logtalk standard library or in other examples. See 
the "NOTES.txt" files inside the library folder, plus the "NOTES.txt" 
and "SCRIPT.txt" files inside each example folder.

Some examples may redefine objects already loaded from other examples.
You may want to restart Logtalk after trying each example.

Some of the examples have been adapted from public available Prolog code 
or from known Prolog text books and are copyrighted by the respective 
authors.

These are programming examples, meaning that you should study the source 
files to fully understand them. However, note that some examples purpose 
is to illustrate general principles rather than being adequate, efficient 
solutions for deployment code.

All examples are formatted using tabs (the recommended setting is a tab
width equivalent to 4 spaces).

By default, compiling an example generates a XML documenting file for 
each compiled entity (object, category, or protocol). See the "xml" 
folder for instructions on how to browse the XML files for on-line 
reading or how to convert the files to a print-ready format such as PDF.

The example folders may contain two files, "tests.lgt" and "tester.lgt".
The file "tests.lgt" contains unit tests for the example. These unit tests
are based on the sample queries found on the example "SCRIPT.txt" file.
The file "tester.lgt" is a loader file that, when loaded, will automatically
run all example unit tests. The POSIX script "tester.sh", found on the
"examples" folder, may be used to run all examples unit tests. This script
works with all compatible back-end Prolog compilers except B-Prolog due to
limitations on the command-line options of this compiler.
