To load all entities in this example compile and load the loader file:

| ?- logtalk_load(loader).

This folder contains an example that shows how to implement class variables 
as defined in Smalltalk. The name shared instance variables is however much
more accurate. In systems like Logtalk that enable the use of explicit 
metaclasses, true class variables are just the class (as an object) own 
instance variables!

This example defines a root class (root) and three instances (instance1, 
instance2, and instance3). The root class defines a shared instance variable 
(using a dynamic predicate) and the setter and getter methods which implement 
the variable sharing behavior.
