This example illustrates some variants of the "diamond problem" 
(multi-inheritance conflicts and ambiguities) and its respective 
solutions on Logtalk.

        A       -- contains default definition for a predicate m/0
	  /   \
    B       C   -- contains redefinitions of the predicate m/0
      \   /
        D       -- inherits both redefinitions of the predicate m/0


There are three variants of the problem:

	diamomd1
		illustrates the inherited definition which is visible due to the
		Logtalk predicate lookup algorithm
	diamond2
		solution for making the overridden inherited definition the 
		visible one
	diamond3
		allows both inherited definitions to be used

To load all entities in this example compile and load the loader file:

| ?- logtalk_load(loader).

To load only a specific variant, compile and load the respective metafile. 
For example:

| ?- logtalk_load(diamond2).
