% start by loading the example:

| ?- logtalk_load(complements(loader)).
...


% find categories that complement objects:

| ?- complements_object(Category, Object).
Category = logging,
Object = employee.
yes 


% turn event support on for messages sent at the command-line
% (i.e. for messages sent from the pseudo-object "user"):

| ?- set_logtalk_flag(events, allow).

yes


% use the event handler defined in the "logging" category for the object "employee":

| ?- employee::name(Name).
Received message name(_16) from user

Name = john
yes


% check the protocol of the object "employee":

| ?- employee::predicates(Predicates).
Received message predicates(_G180) from user

Predicates = [after/3, age/1, before/3, income/1, name/1, predicates/1, salary/1]
yes

| ?- employee::predicate_property(predicates(_), Property).

Property = public ;
Property = static ;
Property = declared_in(logging) ;
Property = defined_in(logging)
yes

| ?- employee::predicate_property(income(_), Property).

Property = public ;
Property = static ;
Property = declared_in(employee) ;
Property = alias_of(salary(_70)) ;
Property = defined_in(employee)


% turn event support off:

| ?- set_logtalk_flag(events, deny).
