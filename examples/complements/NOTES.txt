This folder contains an example that shows how to use a category to 
explicitly complement an existing object (without modifying its source 
code), thus providing functionality similar to Objective-C categories.

The complemented objects need to be compiled with the flag "complements" 
switched on. This is a less than ideal solution that was adapted in order 
to both improve performance of code that doesn't use complementing categories 
and to provide a solution for preventing the use of complementing categories 
to break object encapsulation.
