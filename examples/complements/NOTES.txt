This folder contains an example that shows how to use a category to 
explicitly complement an existing object (without modifying its source 
code), thus providing functionality similar to Objective-C categories.

The complemented objects need to be compiled with the flag "complements" 
set to "allow" (its default value is "deny"). This is a less than ideal
solution that was adapted in order to improve performance of applications
that doesn't use complementing categories and to provide a solution for
preventing the use of complementing categories to break object encapsulation.
