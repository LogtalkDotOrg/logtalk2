To load this example and for sample queries, please see the SCRIPT.txt file.
This example requires a recent version of ECLiPSE, SWI-Prolog, or YAP as the
back-end Prolog compiler. Some of the examples may also work on GNU Prolog,
B-Prolog, and CxProlog.

This folder contains an experimental adaptation of Ajay Bansal implementation
of coinduction for YAP and an experimental wrapper for the SWI-Prolog "coinduction"
library (this wrapper supports using coinductive code in Logtalk objects when
used as a hook object; requires SWI-Prolog 5.10.1 or a later version).
