================================================================


To load this example and for sample queries, please see the SCRIPT.txt file.
This example requires a recent version of CxProlog, ECLiPSE, SICStus Prolog,
SWI-Prolog, or YAP as the back-end Prolog compiler.

Note that Logtalk support for coinduction is still experimental. The two major
issues are lack of robust Prolog support for cyclic terms and lack of support
for tabling of cyclic terms. The first issue prevents using of some back-end
Prolog compilers. The second issue prevents some coinductive predicates to
behave as (theoretically) expected.

This folder contains several examples of coinductive predicates, adapted from
the coinduction papers and from the Feliks Kluzniak's DRA interpreter.
