% start by loading the example:

| ?- logtalk_load(proxies(loader)).
...


% print the area and the perimeter for all circle proxies:

| ?- forall(circle(Id, R, C), circle(Id, R, C)::print).

id: #1, area: 4.75291, perimeter: 7.72831, color: blue
id: #2, area: 43.2412, perimeter: 23.3106, color: yellow
id: #3, area: 0.477836, perimeter: 2.45044, color: green
id: #4, area: 103.508, perimeter: 36.0655, color: black
id: #5, area: 217.468, perimeter: 52.2761, color: cyan
true.


% Logtalk provides a convenient notation for accessing proxies
% represented as Prolog facts when sending a message:

| ?- {circle(_, _, _)}::print, fail; true.

id: #1, area: 4.75291, perimeter: 7.72831, color: blue
id: #2, area: 43.2412, perimeter: 23.3106, color: yellow
id: #3, area: 0.477836, perimeter: 2.45044, color: green
id: #4, area: 103.508, perimeter: 36.0655, color: black
id: #5, area: 217.468, perimeter: 52.2761, color: cyan
true.


% print the area and the perimeter for the circle #2:

| ?- {circle('#2', R, C)}::print.

id: #2, area: 43.2412, perimeter: 23.3106, color: yellow
R = 3.71,
C = yellow.


% construct a list with the areas of all circles:

| ?- findall(Area, {circle(_, _, _)}::area(Area), Areas).

Areas = [4.75291, 43.2412, 0.477836, 103.508, 217.468].
