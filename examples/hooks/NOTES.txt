This folder contains a very simple example of using the Logtalk compiler 
hook to (1) expand author abbreviations in info/1 directives into full 
names and email addresses; (2) convert write/1 goals into write_term/3 
goals where the terms written are quoted and pre-processed by using 
numbervars/3.
