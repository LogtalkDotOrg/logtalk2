This folder contains a set of simple examples illustrating how to use B-Prolog
constraint support with Logtalk. These examples are adapted with permission 
from the original author, Neng-Fa Zhou.

The B-Prolog ::/2 finite-domain built-in predicate clashes with the Logtalk 
::/2 message sending operator. The solution is to use instead the alternative
B-Prolog in/2 built-in predicate.

The built-in predicate_property/2 predicate fails to report some of the 
constraint predicates as built-in predicates. The solution is to encapsulate
calls to these predicates using the {}/1 Logtalk control construct.

When compiling objects and categories making use of B-Prolog Action Rules, the
object "action_rules_hook" must be used as a hook object.
