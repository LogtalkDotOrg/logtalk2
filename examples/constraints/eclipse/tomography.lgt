% This is a little "tomography" problem, taken from an old issue
% of Scientific American.
%
% A matrix which contains zeroes and ones gets "x-rayed" vertically and
% horizontally, giving the total number of ones in each row and column.
% The problem is to reconstruct the contents of the matrix from this
% information. Sample run:
%
%	?- go.
%	    0 0 7 1 6 3 4 5 2 7 0 0
%	 0                         
%	 0                         
%	 8      * * * * * * * *    
%	 2      *             *    
%	 6      *   * * * *   *    
%	 4      *   *     *   *    
%	 5      *   *   * *   *    
%	 3      *   *         *
