To load all entities in this example compile and load the loader file:

| ?- logtalk_load(loader).

You will need to consult the following files in the library directory: 
events_loader, types_loader, and hierarchies_loader. Alternatively, you 
may simply load the library all_loader file to load all library entities.

This folder contains rewritten versions of some of the objects provided 
with previous, 1.x versions, of the Logtalk system. They are intended to 
help the conversion of applications from Logtalk 1.x to 2.x and to
support most of the other examples provided with the current Logtalk
package.

Short description of each example entity:

	class
		default metaclass for all classes
	classp
		protocol of class class

	abstract_class
		default metaclass for all abstract classes
	abstract_classp
		protocol of class abstract_class
	
	object
		root class for class-based hierarchies
	objectp
		protocol of class object
	
	initialization
		category defining methods for object initialization
	
	proto
		root prototype for prototype-based hierarchies
	protop
		protocol for prototype proto

	nil
		object used to represent a void reference

Please note that the entities above are just example definitions.
