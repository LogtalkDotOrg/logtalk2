Logtalk - Object oriented extension to Prolog
Release 2.14.1

=================================================================


To load all objects in this example consult the roots.loader utility
file (note that the *.loader files are Prolog files).

You will need to consult the following files in the library directory: 
events.loader, types.loader, and hierarchies.loader. Alternatively, you 
may load the library/all.loader file to load all library entities.


This folder contains rewritten versions of some of the objects provided 
with previous, 1.x versions, of the Logtalk system. They are intended to 
help the conversion of applications from Logtalk 1.x to 2.x and to
support most of the other examples provided with the current Logtalk
package.
