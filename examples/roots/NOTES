To load all entities in this example compile and load the loader file:

| ?- logtalk_load(loader).

You will need to consult the following files in the library directory: 
events_loader, types_loader, and hierarchies_loader. Alternatively, you 
may load the library all_loader file to load all library entities.


This folder contains rewritten versions of some of the objects provided 
with previous, 1.x versions, of the Logtalk system. They are intended to 
help the conversion of applications from Logtalk 1.x to 2.x and to
support most of the other examples provided with the current Logtalk
package.
