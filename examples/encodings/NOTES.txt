To load this example and for sample queries, please see the SCRIPT file.

This is a very simple example of using the new, experimental encoding/1 
directive, which is fully based on the directive with the same name found 
on recent development releases of SWI-Prolog and YAP. Currently, this 
example requires Logtalk to be run with the SWI-Prolog, YAP, or SICStus 
Prolog compilers.

The following encodings are used in each source file:

	asian.lgt     - UTF-16 (with a BOM)
	babel.lgt     - UTF-8 (with a BOM)
	latin.lgt     - ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1)
	mythology.lgt - UTF-32 (with a BOM)

As of the release date of the Logtalk 2.31.2 version, only SICStus Prolog 
supports UTF-32 encodings. Attempting to compile the "mythology.lgt" source 
file with either YAP or SWI-Prolog results in a misleading syntax error.

Be sure to use a text editor that supports these encodings when opening these 
files. In addition, you may need to configure your text editor to open the 
source file using the declared encoding. Be sure to use a font that supports 
Unicode characters (both for your text editor and for your Prolog compiler 
interpreter).

See the documentation of the Logtalk encoding/1 directive for its possible 
arguments. The Prolog and XML files generated by the Logtalk compiler use the 
same encoding as the compiled source files.
