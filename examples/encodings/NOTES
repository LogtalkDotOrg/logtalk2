To load this example and for sample queries, please see the SCRIPT file.

This is a very simple example of using the new, experimental encoding/1 
directive, which is fully based on the directive with the same name found 
on recent development releases of SWI-Prolog. Currently, this example 
requires Logtalk to be run with the SWI-Prolog compiler.

The "babel.lgt" source file uses UTF-8 encoding. The "latin.lgt" source 
file uses ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1) encoding. Be sure to use a text editor that 
supports these encodings when opening these files. In addition, you may 
need to configure your text editor to open the source file using the 
declared encoding. If you are using the SWI-Prolog GUI application on 
Windows, be sure to select a font which supports Unicode characters.
