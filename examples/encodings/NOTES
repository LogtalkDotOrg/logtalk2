To load this example and for sample queries, please see the SCRIPT 
file.

This is a very simple example of using the new, experimental encoding/1 
directive. Currently, this example requires Logtalk to be run with the 
SWI-Prolog compiler.

The "babel.lgt" source file uses UTF-8 encoding. When browsing its code, 
be sure to use a text editor that supports this encoding. In addition, 
you may need to configure your text editor to open the source file using 
this encoding.
