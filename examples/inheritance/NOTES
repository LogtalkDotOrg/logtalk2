To load all objects in this example consult the inheritance.loader utility
file (note that the *.loader files are Prolog files).

This folder contains examples of public, protected and private inheritance,
for both prototypes and classes/instances. The category "predicates" defines 
a set of three predicates, one public, one protected and one private. This
category is imported by the root objects: "parent" for the prototypes and 
"root" for the classes/instances. Each root object have a set of three 
descendants, each one using one of the inheritance types.
