This folder contains examples of public, protected, and private inheritance,
for both prototype-based and class-based hierarchies.

This example defines a category named "predicates" which specifies three 
predicates, one public, one protected, and one private. This category is 
imported by the root objects: "parent" for the prototype hierarchy and 
"root" for the class hierarchy. Each root object have a set of three 
descendants, each one using one of the inheritance types.

The two object hierarchies are organized as follows:

	parent
		prototype1				% public inheritance
			descendant1
		prototype2				% protected inheritance
			descendant2
		prototype3				% private inheritance
			descendant3

	root
		subclass1				% public inheritance
			instance1
		subclass2				% protected inheritance
			instance2
		subclass3				% private inheritance
			instance3

A second category named "interface", imported by all objects except the 
sub-class instances, allows us to query the objects about their interfaces.
