% start by loading the example:

| ?- logtalk_load(integration(loader)).
...


% integrate the function "quiver" using the recursive adaptive trapezio method with 4 threads

?- quadrec(4)::integrate(quiver, 0.001, 0.999, 0, 1.0e-10, Integral).
Integral = 6.66134e-16.


% integrate the function "quiver" using the recursive adaptive 4 point gaussian scheme with 8 threads

?- quadrec(8)::integrate(quiver, 0.001, 0.999, 4, 1.0e-10, Integral).
Integral = 2.70827e-10 


% the other versions

?- quadsplit(8)::integrate(quiver, 0.001, 0.999, 4, 1.0e-10, Integral).
Integral = 2.70827e-10.
