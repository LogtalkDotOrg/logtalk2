This folder contains a multi-threading implementation of Recursive Gaussian 
Quadrature Methods for Numerical Integration for functions of one-variable.

Adaptive quadrature methods are efficient techniques for numerical 
integration as they compensate for functional variation along the 
integral domain, effectively in regions with large function variations 
a larger sampling of point are used.

The objects (quad) implement the integrate protocol :

Integrate Protocol : argnames is ['Function', 'A', 'B', 'NP','Error', 'Integral']]).

Find the integral of a function of one variable in the interval [A, B] given 
a maximum approximation error. NP-represents the method to be used (0,1,2,3) 

For NP = 0 an adaptive trapezoidal rule is used.
FOR NP=1,2,3,4 an adaptive gaussian quadrature of 1, 2, 3, or points is used.

There are 2 versions quadrec and quadsplit.

For quadrec, the method used for the multithreading is simply to divide the 
initial area amongst the number of threads available (a power of 2) and then 
in each interval the recursive method is applied. The threaded/1 predicate 
is used.

For quadsplit, the method used is again division (split) of the original area 
amongst the number of threads specified. This method has no restriction on 
the number of threads and uses a spwan/collect idea for proving thread goals 
and the predicates threaded_once/1 and threaded_exit/1.
