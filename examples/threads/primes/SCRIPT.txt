% start by loading the loading the example:

| ?- logtalk_load(primes(loader)).
...


% NOTE: the example queries below use a SWI-Prolog proprietary predicate 
% time/1 in order to get accurate goal times. For other Prolog compilers, 
% replace the time/1 call by any appropriate timing calls (e.g. cputime/0).


% calculate the prime numbers in a given interval using a single thread:

?- time(primes(1)::primes(1, 500000, Primes)).
% 67,657,287 inferences, 11.97 CPU in 12.27 seconds (98% CPU, 5652238 Lips)

Primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23|...] 

Yes


% calculate the prime numbers in a given interval by splitting the interval 
% in two sub-intervals and using a thread per sub-interval:

?- time(primes(2)::primes(1, 500000, Primes)).
% 77 inferences, 11.71 CPU in 7.50 seconds (156% CPU, 7 Lips)

Primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23|...] 

Yes


% calculate the prime numbers in a given interval by splitting the interval 
% in four sub-intervals and using a thread per sub-interval:

?- time(primes(4)::primes(1, 500000, Primes)).
% 129 inferences, 11.57 CPU in 3.99 seconds (290% CPU, 11 Lips)

Primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23|...] 

Yes
