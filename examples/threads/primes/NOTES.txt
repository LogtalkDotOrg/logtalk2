To load this example and for sample queries, please see the SCRIPT file.

This folder contains a simple example of calculating prime numbers in a 
given interval using multiple threads. Try to run the example in single 
and multi-processor (or multi-core) computers and compare the results. 
Most Prolog compilers allows you to measure the time taken for proving 
a goal using proprietary predicates.

Note that this example is only meant to illustrate how to use Logtalk 
multi-threading predicates, not to taken as the efficient solution for 
finding primes numbers on a given interval (with or without threads).
