% load the example:

% NOTE: the example queries below use a SWI-Prolog proprietary predicate 
% time/1 in order to get accurate goal times. This predicate is also found 
% on recent development versions of YAP and XSB. For other Prolog compilers, 
% replace the time/1 call by any appropriate timing calls (e.g. cputime/0).
