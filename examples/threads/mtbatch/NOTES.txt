This folder provides a parametric object for running multi-threading 
benchmarks. The object parameter must be instantiated with an atom 
representing the back-end Prolog compiler being used:

	SWI-Prolog: swi
	YAP:        yap
	XSB:        xsb

This is necessary due to the different built-in predicates used by each 
Prolog compiler for timing statistics.

For example, the following goal will run all benchmark tests (assuming 
we're using SWI-Prolog as the back-end compiler):

	| ?- mtbatch(swi)::run.

You may also run just a single benchmark test a given number of times.
For example:

	| ?- mtbatch(swi)::run(primes, 10).

The following tests are available:

	primes
	msort
	qsort
	fib
	hanoi
	tak
	fft
	integration
	search
