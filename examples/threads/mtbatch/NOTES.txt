This folder provides an object for running multi-threading benchmarks. The
supported back-end Prolog compilers are	SWI-Prolog, YAP, and XSB.

For example, the following goal will run all benchmark tests:

	| ?- mtbatch::run.

You may also run just a single benchmark test a given number of times.
For example:

	| ?- mtbatch::run(primes, 10).

The following tests are available:

	primes			(independent and-parallelism)
	msort			(independent and-parallelism)
	qsort			(independent and-parallelism)
	fib				(independent and-parallelism)
	hanoi			(independent and-parallelism)
	tak				(independent and-parallelism)
	fft				(independent and-parallelism)
	integration		(independent and-parallelism)
	integration2d	(independent and-parallelism)
	search			(competitive or-parallelism)

For the same back-end Prolog compiler, the benchmark results can show 
significant variation depending on the operating-system and if you're 
using a 32 bits or a 64 bits version.
