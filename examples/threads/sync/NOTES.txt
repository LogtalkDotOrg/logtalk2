To load this example and for sample queries, please see the SCRIPT file.

This folder contains a simple multi-threading example illustrating the 
use of the "synchronized" predicate directive to cope with methods that 
have side-effects.

The object defined in the example source file, "sync.lgt", defines a 
predicate named waste_time/0 that is used to delay the execuion of goals 
in order to better illustrate the semantics of the "synchronized" predicate 
directive. This predicate uses a counter that you might need to adjust, 
depending on your Prolog compiler and computer performance.
