This folder contains a multi-threading implementation of the merge sort 
algorithm.  Depending on the size of the lists that are ordered, using 
only one thread can be faster. The number of threads to use in sorting 
is set using the msort/1 object parameter. You may need to adjust the 
size of the memory areas used by your Prolog compiler, depending on the 
size of the lists you want to sort.

This example uses a simple implementation of the merge sort algorithm,
intended only to illustrate Logtalk multi-threading features. For any 
other purpose, you may find the following paper a worthwhile reading:
