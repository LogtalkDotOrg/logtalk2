This folder contains a simple single-threaded and multi-threaded versions 
of the merge sort algorithm.  Depending on the size of the lists that are 
ordered, the single-threaded version is often faster due not only to the 
overhead of thread creation on the multi-threaded version but also because 
the merge of the sorted sub-lists, where the bulk of the sorting work is 
performed, does not take advantage of multi-threading.

This example uses a simple implementation of the merge sort algorithm,
intended only to illustrate Logtalk multi-threading features. For any 
other purpose, you may find the following paper a worthwhile reading:
