This folder contains some examples of multi-threading programming.
Multi-threading programming is only supported on some Prolog compilers.
Currently this includes SWI-Prolog and YAP. Moreover, multi-threading 
may be turned off by default. In order to run the examples, you may need 
to first turn on multi-threading support on the Prolog config files.
