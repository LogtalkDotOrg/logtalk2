This folder contains a Logtalk implementation of the classical "dining 
philosophers" multi-threading problem.

For more information, consult e.g. the following URL:

	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem

Two different implementations are provided, both using the same solution for 
avoiding deadlock (which is having one philosopher picking its chopsticks 
in a different order from the other philosophers; see the URL above for 
details): one implementations uses a category and five philosopher objects 
while the second implementation uses a parametric object.
