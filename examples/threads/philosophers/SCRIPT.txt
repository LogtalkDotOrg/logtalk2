% five meals for each philosopher, each one spending a maximum of five seconds of continuous thinking or eating:

| ?- threaded_ignore(p1::run(5, 5)), threaded_ignore(p2::run(5, 5)), threaded_ignore(p3::run(5, 5)), threaded_ignore(p4::run(5, 5)), threaded_ignore(p5::run(5, 5)).

% same problem as above but using a parametric object for representing the philosophers:

| ?- threaded_ignore(philosopher(p1,cs1,cs2)::run(5, 5)), threaded_ignore(philosopher(p2,cs2,cs3)::run(5, 5)), threaded_ignore(philosopher(p3,cs3,cs4)::run(5, 5)), threaded_ignore(philosopher(p4,cs4,cs5)::run(5, 5)), threaded_ignore(philosopher(p5,cs1,cs5)::run(5, 5)).
