This folder contains a simple multi-threading example illustrating how 
to use the Logtalk built-in predicates threaded_wait/1 and threaded_notify/1 
for synchronizing threads using shared resources. The example consists of 
two persons, a student and a teacher, sharing a blackboard chalk and eraser.
