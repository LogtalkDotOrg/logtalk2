This folder contains an example of using a category to define a simple 
logging support for objects. This example illustrates how to define in 
a category a set of predicates that handle a dynamic predicate in the 
context of "this". Although the database built-in methods, such as 
assertz/1 or retractall/1, are straightforward to use, calling the 
dynamic predicate must be performed using the message sending ::/2 
control construct (note that a direct call to the dynamic predicate 
would result in a compilation error as it would be interpreted as a 
call to a local category dynamic predicate: categories cannot contain
clauses for dynamic predicates).
