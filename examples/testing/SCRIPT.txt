% start by loading the example:

| ?- logtalk_load(testing(loader)).
...

% the test will auto-run, thanks to initialization directives

% you may also edit the initialization directives in the objects
% defined in the "testing.lgt" file in order to divert the test
% results to a "results.txt" file in the example directory
