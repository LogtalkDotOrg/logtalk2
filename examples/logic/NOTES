To load all entities in this example compile and load the loader file:

| ?- logtalk_load(loader).

This folder contains an object which implements a translator from 
logic propositions to a set of clauses in conjunctive normal form. 
The translator code is partially based on code published in the 
book "Programming in Prolog" by W. F. Clocksin and C. S. Mellish.

The following operators are used for representing logic connectives:

	negation: ~
	disjunction: v
	conjunction: &
	implication: =>
	equivalence: <=>

Quantifiers are represented using the following notation:

	universal: all(X, P)
	existential: exists(X, P)

The two main object predicates are translate/2 and step_by_step/2.
The first predicate, translate/2, translate a logic proposition to 
a list of clauses. The second predicate, step_by_step/2, performs 
the same translations as translate/2 but also prints the results 
of each conversion step.
