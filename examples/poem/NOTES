The example in this folder is an adaptation of an example of POEM, an 
object-oriented extension to Prolog developed by Ben Staveley-Taylor.

To load all entities in this example compile and load the loader file:

| ?- logtalk_load(loader).

Contrary to the other cases, to test this example consult the Prolog 
file SCRIPT and then call the predicate run/0 to run the example.
