This folder contains an example that shows how to implement instance variables 
as defined in class-based object-oriented programming languages.

This example defines a root class (root) and three instances (instance1, 
instance2, and instance3). The root class defines an instance variable 
(using a dynamic predicate) and the corresponding setter and getter methods.
The root class is used to store a default value for the instance variable.
