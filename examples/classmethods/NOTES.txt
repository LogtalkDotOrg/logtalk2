This example illustrates how to define "class methods" as found on class-
based object-oriented programming languages such as Java or Objective-C.
Logtalk classes are objects. Therefore, class methods are simply instance
methods defined in the class of the class, i.e. in its meta-class.

This example defines the following objects:

	circle
		class representing common features of geometric circles
		such as radius and position

	metacircle
		meta-class of class circle defining "class methods" for
		creating instances and calculating areas

	c42
		static instance of class "circle"
