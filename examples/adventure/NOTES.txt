This folder contains Logtalk versions of some simple Prolog text
adventures:

    - sleepy, written by David Matuszek, Villanova University
    - spider, written by David Matuszek, Villanova University
    - wumpus, written by Dan Cliburn, University of the Pacific

For the "sleepy" and "spider" adventures, I applied the necessary
changes to ensure compatibility with all the back-end Prolog compilers
that you can use with Logtalk, rewrote some of the code to avoid creation
of choice-points, and added a very simple command-line interface.

For the "wumpus" adventure, I applied the necessary changes to ensure
compatibility with all the back-end Prolog compilers that you can use
with Logtalk.

Any bugs introduced while adapting these text adventure examples to
Logtalk are solely my responsibility.

There is no support for restarting a text adventure. If you want to play
again, you must restart your Logtalk section and load the example again.
