Logtalk - Object oriented extension to Prolog

=================================================================

To load all objects in this example consult the reflection.loader utility
file (note that the *.loader files are Prolog files). Run this example with 
no other examples loaded at the same time.

This folder contains an example that shows how to implement a reflective
class-based system. There are three main classes:

	object - root of the inheritance graph
	class - default metaclass for all instantiable classes
	abstract_class - default metaclass for all abstract classes

Each class inherit all the methods form the other two classes and from 
itself (without any inheritance loops of course ;-).

You can find more sophisticated versions of these classes in the roots
example.
