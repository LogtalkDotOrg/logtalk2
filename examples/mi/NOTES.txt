To load this example and for sample queries, please see the SCRIPT.txt file.

There are two examples in this folder. The first one is an adoption of a 
multi-inheritance C++ example found on the D. M. Capper book "Introducing 
C++ for Scientists, Engineers and Mathematicians" published by 
Springer-Verlag. It uses dynamic predicates for storing state. The second 
example is a variant of the first one using parametric objects.

This example defines the following objects:

	space
		this object space stores spatial coordinates using a dynamic 
		predicate

	time
		this object stores a time stamp using a dynamic predicate

	space_time
		this object inherits from both the objects space and time


	space(_,_,_)
		similar to object space but using parameters instead of dynamic 
		predicates

	time(_)
		similar to object space but using a parameter instead of a dynamic 
		predicate

	space_time(_,_,_,_)
		this object inherits from both the objects space(_,_,_) and time(_)
