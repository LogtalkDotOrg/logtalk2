To load this example and for sample queries, please see the SCRIPT.txt file.

This example contains simple meta-interpreters for pure Prolog encapsulated 
in Logtalk categories:

	solver
		simple meta-interpreter for pure Prolog

	proof_tree
		simple meta-interpreter for pure Prolog returning the proof 
		tree for successful queries

	tracer
		simple meta-interpreter for pure Prolog that traces proof 
		construction

To use a meta-interpreter with an object, simply import the corresponding 
category.

Defining meta-interpreters as categories allows the use of the built-in 
predicate clause/2 to access the clauses of object predicates without 
forcing these predicates to be declared public or protected. Within a 
category, calls to the built-in predicate clause/2 retrieve clauses in 
"this", i.e. in the database of the object importing the category.
