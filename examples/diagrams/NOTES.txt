This example illustrates how to generate entity diagrams for source files
and for libraries of source files using the Logtalk reflection features to
collect the relevant information and the DOT language for representing the
diagrams.

The diagrams .dot files are created on the current directory by default.
These files can be easily converted into a printable format such as PDF
or Postscript. For example, using the dot command-line executable we can
simply type:

	dot -Tpdf diagram.dot > diagram.pdf 

When generating diagrams for libraries, is possible to split a diagram with
several disconnected entity graphs using the ccomps command-line executable.
For example:

	ccomps -x -o subdiagram.dot diagram.dot

For more information on the DOT language and related tools see:

When using Windows, there are know issues with some Prolog compilers due
to the internal representation of paths. If you encounter problems with a
specific back-end Prolog compiler, try to use another supported back-end
Prolog compiler when generating diagrams.
