To load this example and for sample queries, please see the SCRIPT file.

This example illustrates how to generate entity diagrams for source files
and for libraries of source files using the Logtalk reflection features to
collect the relevant information and the DOT language for representing the
diagrams.

The diagrams .dot files are created on the current directory. These files
can be easily converted into a printable format such as Postscript or PDF.
For example, on POSIx systems we can simply type:

	$ dot -Tpdf points.dot > points.pdf 

For more information on the DOT language and related tools see:
