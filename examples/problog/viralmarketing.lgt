% The viral marketing example consists of a social network of friend relations. You have to decide which persons to market. Sending marketing has a cost of 2, but might cause people to buy your product, giving you a profit of 5. When someone buys the product, it becomes more likely that his friends also buy the product.

% Set the inference method to K-best to limit the complexity. This means that only the K most likely proofs for each utility attribute are considered as an underestimate of the probabilities and utilities. In the viral marketing example, this means that the probability that someone buys the product only depends on a limited number of other people in the social network,  regardless of the size of the social network.
