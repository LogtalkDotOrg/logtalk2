To load all objects in this example consult the symdiff.loader utility
file (note that the *.loader files are Prolog files).

This folder contains an example of using parametric objects to implement
symbolic expression differentiation and simplification.

Limitations:

	- the expression that we intend to differentiate or simplify 
	must be a compound term. Accepted functors are *, +, -, **, and log.

	- use as a variable the atom x.

	- only integers can be used as constants.

This example is still incomplete. For example, using sum distribuition 
property to simplify expressions is not yet implemented.
