To load all entities in this example compile and load the loader file:

| ?- logtalk_load(loader).

You will also need to load the library hierarchies_loader file.
Alternatively, you may load the library all_loader file to load 
all library entities.

This folder contains an example of using parametric objects to implement
symbolic expression differentiation and simplification.

Current limitations:

	- the expression that we intend to differentiate or simplify 
	must be a compound term. Accepted functors are *, +, -, **, and log.

	- use as a variable the atom x.

	- only integers can be used as constants.

This example is still incomplete. For example, using sum distribution 
property to simplify expressions is not yet implemented.
