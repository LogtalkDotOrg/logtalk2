This folder contains an example of using conditional compilation to implement
a portable operating-system interface for seven Prolog compilers: SWI-Prolog,
YAP, XSB, GNU-Prolog, B-Prolog, SICStus Prolog, and ECLiPSe. For other back-
end Prolog compilers, a warning is printed. Note that this is just an example
of using the conditional compilation directives. This code should not be used
without careful testing in a production environment.
