This folder contains an example of using conditional compilation to implement
a portable operating-system interface for ten Prolog compilers: SWI-Prolog,
YAP, XSB, GNU-Prolog, B-Prolog, SICStus Prolog, ECLiPSe, Ciao, CxProlog, and
Qu-Prolog. For other back-end Prolog compilers, a warning is printed.

Note that this is just an example of using the conditional compilation
directives. This code should not be used without careful testing in a
production environment.
