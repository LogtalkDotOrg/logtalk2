file.

This highly experimental example requires the use of a back-end Prolog
compiler with support for CHR. Tested with Qu-Prolog, SICStus Prolog,
SWI-Prolog, and YAP. The individual examples are adaptations of examples
distributed with CHR.

An issue with the implementations of CHR found on SICStus Prolog,
SWI-Prolog, and YAP prevents loading more than one Logtalk object
or category containing CHR code at a time. For details on these
CHR implementations see:

	http://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~tom.schrijvers/CHR/

The example in the "combining.lgt" file currently requires Qu-Prolog and
illustrates how to combine constraints defined in different objects.
