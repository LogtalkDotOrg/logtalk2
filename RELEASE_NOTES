RELEASE NOTES
=============


2.22.5 - January 24, 2005

	Updated K-Prolog config file, correcting a showstopper bug and enabling  
	support for using the "library" notation for loading source files.

	Added scripts for easy integration of Logtalk with K-Prolog.

	Updated JIProlog config file in order to workaround a compiler bug 
	with the write_canonical/2 predicate and null atoms and to allow smart 
	compilation of source files.

	Changed format of preprocessor and runtime dynamic predicates that deal 
	with predicate indicators for better performance.

	Updated the syntax coloring file for the TextMate text editor, adding 
	some missing ISO Prolog predicates.

	Added syntax coloring for the predicate logtalk_library_path/2 to the 
	supported text editors.


2.22.4 - January 12, 2005

	Simplified method lookup cache tables, resulting in a small message 
	sending performance speedup. Improved method lookup caching for 
	parametric objects. Added support for caching method lookups for 
	parametric objects whose parameters contain cyclic terms.

	Added a new category, "assignvars", to the Logtalk standard library, 
	containing an adaptation of the implementation of logical assignable 
	variables developed by Nobukuni Kino. Added a new example, "assignvars",
	illustrating some possible uses of assignable variables in the context 
	of parametric objects.

	Simplified compilation of op/3 directives: there is no longer need to 
	repeat the directives both before and inside an entity in order to make 
	the operators global and also use them in the compilation process.

	Simplified installation instructions.

	Corrected a compiler bug in the code that checks and prints a warning 
	when redefined parametric objects.

	Corrected a bug in the built-in predicate abolish_category/1, which 
	failed to delete import relation clauses between the category being 
	abolished and other categories.


2.22.3 - December 30, 2004

	Added a configuration file for XSB 2.7.

	Corrected a bug where the use of alternative compilation directories 
	would fail the first time the logtalk_compile/1-2 or logtalk_load/1-2 
	predicates are used for a given file or library.

	Corrected a bug in the built-in methods asserta/1 and assertz/1 when 
	asserting facts into an object being debugged, which resulted in wrong 
	execution context information being printed when tracing calls to 
	the asserted facts.

	Corrected a bug in the built-in methods asserta/1 and assertz/1 when 
	asserting rules into an object being debugged, which resulted in rule 
	bodies compiled with no information being printed for the rule head 
	when tracing calls to the asserted rules.

	Corrected a bug in the dynamic creation of objects, protocols, and 
	categories when the debug flag is on, which resulted in the table of 
	entities being debugged not being updated.

	Corrected a bug in the handling of exceptions thrown when using the 
	built-in debugger, which resulted in exceptions always being turned 
	into failures.


2.22.2 - December 24, 2004

	Improved performance of dynamic creation and compilation of objects, 
	protocols, and categories.

	Improved error-checking code of methods asserta/1 and assertz/1 to 
	prevent asserting of non-callable terms as facts.

	Improved error checking for documenting directives (info/1 and info/2).

	Improved the XSB integration script (make_xsblgt.sh) in order to use the 
	configuration file and the libpaths file available from the $LOGTALKUSER 
	directory.

	Improved installation instructions and installation scripts documentation.

	Added documentation to the user manual on describing predicate exceptions 
	using the info/2 directive.

	Corrected a bug in the predicate_property/2 built-in method when called 
	with the second argument instantiated to the alias/1 property.


2.22.1 - December 6, 2004

	Improved installation instructions. Updated the Windows installation 
	JScript script to add the Logtalk directories "misc" and "xml" to the 
	system PATH environment variable and to reuse the environment variable 
	LOGTALKUSER if already defined.

	Added helper batch scripts (misc/cplgtdirs.bat, xml/lgt2html.bat, and 
	xml/lgt2pdf.bat) for easily running the corresponding Windows JScript 
	scripts from the command-line (the two xml/lgt2*.bat scripts run the 
	corresponding *.js scripts stored in the %LOGTALKUSER%/xml directory 
	in order to support user customization).

	Updated the lgt2html.* and lgt2pdf.* shell scripts to use the environment 
	variable LOGTALKUSER instead of LOGTALKHOME for finding supporting files, 
	thus allowing for end-user customization of the scripts and their related 
	files.

	Added documentation on read-only compiler flags (which are defined in the 
	configuration files) to the User Manual.

	Updated the misc/lgt_install.js JScript installer script to workaround a 
	Windows Scripting Host bug which may result in broken shortcuts in the 
	created "Logtalk" program group.


2.22.0 - November 29, 2004

	Implemented a notion of library as simply a directory containing source 
	files. Added a new dynamic predicate, logtalk_library_path/2, for 
	specifying library paths. Added a sample file (libpaths/libpaths.pl) for 
	setting library paths for the Logtalk standard library and for all the 
	supplied examples.

	Added support for using the notation <library>(<entity>) with the built-in
	predicates logtalk_compile/1-2 and logtalk_load/1-2 for compiling and 
	loading source files contained on a library, without the need to first 
	change the current working directory.

	Changed the library and the examples loading instructions to use the new 
	notation <library>(<entity>).

	Improved installation instructions and installation scripts. Added a new 
	environment variable, LOGTALKUSER, for defining the location of the copies 
	of the user-modifiable Logtalk files in a multiple users setup environment.

	Added utility predicates to most configuration files for querying and 
	changing the current working directory (needed for the <library>(<entity>) 
	notation to work).

	Corrected a bug in the code that checks for file existence when compiling 
	or loading source files and source metafiles.


2.21.6 - November 15, 2004

	Added support for using alternative directories for storing the Prolog files 
	and the XML documenting files resulting from entity compilation. A new read-
	only flag, "altdirs", allows the support for alternative directories to be 
	turned on the configuration files of Prolog compilers providing the necessary 
	operating-system access predicates for implementing this feature.

	Improved installation instructions and reporting of default compilation flags 
	at startup.

	Added a sorely missing "Hello World!" example :-)


2.21.5 - November 2, 2004

	Added a new optimization compiler flag, "events", which can be used to switch 
	off event-driven programming support when not needed, on a per-object basis, 
	resulting in improved message sending performance.

	Small performance optimization to the runtime creation of dynamic objects, 
	protocols, and categories.

	Updated the error handling code of the built-in predicates create_object/4, 
	create_protocol/3, and create_category/4 in order to throw an instantiation 
	error when called with a non-instantiated argument.

	Updated the benchmarks example to calculate and subtract the benchmark loop 
	time in order to print absolute timings for the benchmarked goals.

	Updated the Qu-Prolog patching instructions to also convert Logtalk source 
	metafiles.

	Fixed a typo on the XSB compatibility notes in the configs/NOTES file.


2.21.4 - October 26, 2004

	Corrected a silly bug in the definition of the predicate repeat/1 on the 
	new "benchmarks" example.


2.21.3 - October 25, 2004

	Corrected a silly bug in message translation which resulted in a small 
	performance loss. Simplified implementation of message sending predicate 
	::/2, resulting in a small performance improvement.

	Added a new section on message sending performance to the user manual.

	Added a new example, "benchmarks", for helping measuring performance of 
	Logtalk message sending between Prolog compilers and for comparing message 
	sending with predicate calls in plain Prolog and with calls to modules 
	predicates.

	Updated the YAP configuration file to hide some of the book-keeping tables 
	of the Logtalk runtime engine and to use statistics/2 instead of cputime/0 
	for more accurate timings.

	Updated the Logtalk shell installation script to create the $prefix/bin 
	directory if it does not exist.

	The lgt2pdf.sh and lgt2html.sh shell scripts now use "rm -f" when removing 
	the DTD and XSD files in order to avoid prompting the the user about the file 
	permissions.

	Updated the cplgtdirs.sh shell script to make all copied files user writable.


2.21.2 - October 18, 2004

	Added support for declaring grammar rule non-terminals as public, protected, 
	private, dynamic, or discontiguous using the notation Functor//Arity. Added 
	support for documenting non-terminals using the info/2 and mode/2 directives.

	Added support for a new alias/1 predicate property.

	New experimental config file for JIProlog 3.0 (see the configs/NOTES file 
	for details).

	Added a mode bundle for the TextMode 1.0.x (MacOS X) text editor providing 
	syntax highlighting, folding, and code snippets for editing Logtalk source 
	files. Corrected a bug in the syntax coloring of the :-/1-2 operator on the 
	SubEthaEdit 2.x text editor.


2.21.1 - September 27, 2004

	Added experimental support for a new built-in method, expand_term/2, which 
	allows access to the Logtalk grammar rule translator. Corrected bug in the 
	expansion of \+/1 in grammar rule bodies. Optimized code generated for 
	message sending calls in the body of grammar rules. Improved error handling 
	of the built-in methods phrase/2 and phrase/3. Added new section on definite 
	clause grammars to the user manual. Added two new objects to the "dcgs" 
	example, dcgtest and bypass, containing test cases for the Logtalk DCG 
	translator and illustrating some programming techniques with grammar rules.

	Corrected a bug in the implementation of the built-in method clause/2 which 
	prevented access to clauses of local dynamic predicates.

	Corrected some dead links on the XHTML manuals.

	Corrected a bug in the syntax coloring of numbers on the SubEthaEdit 2.x 
	text editor.


2.21.0 - September 14, 2004

	Added a new predicate directive, alias/3, which allows the definition of 
	alternative predicate names in order to improve readability of inherited 
	features and to solve conflicts between implemented, imported, or inherited 
	predicates.

	Added new example, "aliases", illustrating the use of the new alias/3 
	predicate directive for improving readability of inherited features.

	Added new example, "diamonds", illustrating problems and solutions for the 
	"diamond problem" (multi-inheritance conflicts and ambiguities) using the 
	new alias/3 predicate directive.

	Allow categories to import other categories, i.e. allow categories to be 
	defined as a composition of other categories. This feature should only be 
	used when extending a category without breaking its functional cohesion 
	(for example, when a modified version of a category is needed for importing 
	into several unrelated objects). 

	Added new example, "engines", illustrating importing a category from another 
	category.

	Updated the syntax coloring configuration files for the supported text 
	editors for the new alias/3 predicate directive.

	Added autocomplete strings for Logtalk methods and for Logtalk and Prolog 
	built-in predicates and directives to the SubEthaEdit 2.x text editor.

	Corrected a bug which prevented compilation of metafiles containing 
	parametric entities.

	Added a Windows JScript script for installing Logtalk. Improved the Windows 
	JScript scripts used for easy integration of Logtalk with selected Prolog 
	compilers.

	Improved user manual section on defining object and category metapredicates 
	and on calling non-stardard Prolog built-in metapredicates. Improved the 
	description of some compiler options.

	lgtxml.xsl, lgthtml.xsl, and lgtxhtml.xsl files.

	Replaced the Windows JScript scripts lgt2pdf.js and lgt2html.js by their 
	final versions (the wrong ones shipped with Logtalk version 2.20.0).

	Updated the "errors" example to illustrate possible conflict errors when 
	using the uses/2 directive.

	Updated the RPM logtalk.spec file to use the .tgz archive extension.


2.20.0 - August 16, 2004

	Corrected a bug in the lgtxhtml.xsl XSLT file where a wrong reference to 
	the Logtalk CSS file is being used in the xml-stylesheet tag.

	The iso_initialization_dir/1 compiler option is now a read only flag, 
	defined in the configuration files.


2.19.1 - August 2, 2004

	Corrected a bug where entities could not be reloaded if they depend on 
	other, not yet loaded entities.

	Corrected a bug where compiler options would not be used when compiling 
	source metafiles.

	Corrected several typos on the Logtalk manuals.


2.19.0 - July 26, 2004

	Added support for defining more than one entity per file using Logtalk 
	source metafiles (*.mlgt), which the runtime engine automatically splits 
	on single entity source files plus loading and compiling helper files.

	Updated the URL used on the automatically generated XML documenting files 
	when compiling entities with the option doctype(web).

	contain only directives and no entity definition.

	Simplified loading of library and example entities by using Logtalk source 
	files as loader files.

	Some improvements to the documentation, including the QUICK_START file and 
	the User Manual for first-time users, and to the example descriptions.

	Changed debugger command "e" to print exception terms instead of exiting 
	Logtalk session.

	Corrected a compilation error with B-Prolog due to operator priorities.

	Corrected a possible problem with the redefinition of loaded entities that

	library.

	Added experimental implementations for some Prolog compilers of the library 
	portable protocol for operating system access (systemp.lgt). See the file 
	library/experimental/NOTES for details.


2.17.0 - April 26, 2004

	Added built-in debugging support implemented through the definition of a 
	new pseudo-object named "debugger". Added "debug" compiler option. Renamed 
	library entities "debuggerp" and "debugger" to, respectively, "event_dbgp" 
	and "event_dbg".

	Improved installation instructions for multi-user environments. Added 
	a shell script for installing Logtalk in Unix and Unix-like operating 
	systems. Added a shell script for copying Logtalk xml, examples, and 
	library directories to the user home directory.

	GNU Prolog, Qu-Prolog, SICStus Prolog, SWI-Prolog, and YAP.

	Corrected bug in the definition of the pseudo-object "user" that resulted 
	in mixed up metapredicate and type predicate properties.

	Removed config files for outdated versions of Qu-Prolog, SWI-Prolog, ECLiPSe,
	K-Prolog, CIAO, YAP, Amzi! Prolog, LPA Win-Prolog, SICStus Prolog, and XSB.


2.16.2 - April 2, 2004

	Corrected a bug in the library category monitor (file library/monitor.lgt) 
	that prevents its compilation.

	Changed the possible values of the read-only flag startup_message (defined 
	in the config files) to "flags" (print banner and flag values), "banner" 
	(print only the banner), and "none" (do not print neither the banner nor the 
	flag values). Default value is "flags".

	Updated the "errors" example to illustrate the error messages thrown when 
	trying to redefine Logtalk built-in control constructs.

	Corrected a small problem with the Logtalk language specification file for 
	Apple's Xcode IDE.

	Added preliminary support for syntax coloring using the Windows text editor 
	Crimson Editor.


2.16.1 - March 23, 2004

	The local built-in method parameter/2 can now be used inside categories 
	(but please read the warnings about such practice on the user manual).

	Updated the Logtalk compiler to report an error when the user tries to 
	redefine a message sending or external call control construct inside an 
	object or category.

	Corrected a bug in the compilation of metacalls whose meta-arguments are 
	variables.

	Removed references to file sax.jar from the scripts used to convert XML 
	documenting files into (X)HTML. Updated scripts html.sh, htmlnt.cmd, and

2.16.0 - March 3, 2004

	Logtalk is now distributed under the Artistic License 2.0.

	Operators declared inside an entity are now local to the entity, not 
	affecting the global operator table (complying with the Logtalk language 
	specification). Input and output of terms from inside objects and 
	categories now work as expected in the presence of local operator 
	declarations. Added a new example named "operators".

	Updated built-in method predicate_property/2 for returning metapredicate/1 
	properties for both Logtalk and Prolog metapredicates.

	Added support for calls to non-ISO Prolog standard built-in metapredicates 
	inside objects and categories. Added support for the declaration of non-ISO 
	Prolog standard metapredicates in the config files.

	Small change to the way the Logtalk compiler reports the compilation of
	entities. Small optimizations to the compilation of Logtalk source files.

	Corrected a bug where calls to Logtalk built-in predicates would be 
	reported as non-portable when the value of compiler option portability is 
	set to warning.

	New config file for Qu-Prolog 6.4 (see the configs/NOTES file for details).

	Corrected a problem with the syntax coloring of quoted atoms and strings 
	in the SubEthaEdit text editor. Added more accurate syntax highlight for
	built-in methods and built-in predicates.

	Updated the syntax coloring configuration files for all supported text 
	editors to recognize the file extension used by the config files.


2.15.6 - February 9, 2004

    Added "xmlspec" compiler option in order to specify the extension (dtd 
    or xsd) of the file describing the XML documenting files specification.

	Renamed compiler option "named_anonymous_vars" to the more appropriated 
	name "underscore_vars". Changed possible option values to "dont_care" and 
	"singletons" (default).

    Added XSLT file for converting XML documenting files to XHTML 1.0 Strict 
    files. Set the default encoding of all XSLT files to UTF-8.

    Added syntax coloring support for the KDE Kate and Kwrite text editors.

    Improved syntax coloring configuration files for VIM, jEdit, NEdit, 
    SubEthaEdit, and Emacs text editors.

	Removed outdated support for MacOS X Project Builder and added support 
	for the new MacOS X Xcode developer tool.

	Corrected bug in the built-in predicate current_logtalk_flag/2 that 
	prevented some flag values from being returned after using the built-in 
	predicate set_logtalk_flag/2.

	Corrected bug in the shapes example (wrong placement of the declaration 
	of the predicate side/1).


2.15.5 - December 30, 2003

    predicate definitions needed for successful compilation of all entities 
    in the Logtalk standard library.

	Updated manual pages to comply with XHTML 1.0 Strict and to provide 
	better navigation.


2.15.4 - July 9, 2003

	Corrected a spurious backtracking bug in the DCG rule translator. Added 
	two more examples of DCGs.

	New config file for XSB 2.6. Updated Logtalk compiler to compile cleanly 
	under XSB after applying the patch described in configs/NOTES.

	Updated SWI-Prolog config file to hide compiled entity predicates (requires 
	SWI-Prolog 5.2.3 or later version). New optional file configs/swihook.pl 
	contains hook code that allows Logtalk entities to be compiled and loaded 
	using SWI-Prolog load_files/2 and consult/1 predicates.

	Syntax definition file for the Hydra 1.1 (MacOS X) text editor providing 
	syntax coloring for editing Logtalk source files.

2.15.3 - June 27, 2003

	Updated experimental support for DCG rules to prevent over-simplification 
	of unification goals in the compilation of rules to clauses. Push-back 
	lists can now be used on rule heads.

	corresponding entity table (implying recompilation of all entities).

	Updated GNU Prolog config file to hide compiled entity predicates.

	Updated SWI-Prolog config file for better integration of Logtalk with 
	this compiler.


2.15.2 - April 2, 2003

	Experimental support for DCG rules inside categories and objects. Added

	Updated GNU Prolog config file to not hide compiled entity predicates in 
	order to avoid incompatibilities with dynamic entities.


2.15.1 - March 8, 2003

	New example, msglog, of using events and monitors to record, replay, and 
	print user messages.

	Corrected a typo on the jEdit templates that resulted in syntax errors.

	Corrected a bug in the built-in methods asserta/1 and assertz/1 when 
	asserting predicate rules.

	The built-in predicates logtalk_compile/1-2 and logtalk_load/1-2 now 
	accept both an entity (an atom) or a list of entities (a list of atoms).

	Optimized the code generated when compiling or asserting clauses for 
	dynamic predicates.

	Optimized protected inheritance performance on some Prolog compilers.


2.14.6 - December 31, 2002

	Corrected a bug where the opening directive of an object that, 
	simultaneously, implements a protocol, imports a categoty, instantiates 
	a class, and specializes a superclass, will not be recognized.


2.14.5 - December 20, 2002

	New compiler option, doctype, to set the doctype reference (if any) 
	in the XML documenting files. Default value is "local" for backward 
	compatibility. Updated the user manual section on compiler options.

	The Logtalk built-in predicate logtalk_version/3 should be considered 
	deprecated (use current_logtalk_flag/3 instead). All references to this 
	predicate have been removed from the manuals.

	Updated the jEdit syntax coloring config file for the new jEdit 4.1 
	version.

	Updated the lgtpdfa4.xsl and lgtpdfus.xsl XSLT files for compatibility

	at startup.

	Reworked Logtalk pre-processor compilation and loading reports. Compiler 
	option "report" now togles between normal reporting (as specified by the 
	other flags) and silent compilation/loading of source files.


2.10.0 - April 5, 2002

	Scope of object asserted predicates for which there is no declaration is 
	now a function of the context instead of always being declared public. 
	Asserting in this, the predicate is declared private, asserting in self, 
	the predicate is declared protected, otherwise the predicate is declared 
	public.

	Throw an error if a category contains clauses for dynamic predicates.

	Updated documentation on categories and built-in methods for database 
	handling.

	Retracting all clauses for a dynamic predicate from an object now allows 
	an inherited definition to be called when sending the corresponding

	errors example.

	Corrected a compiler bug where the entity relation tables only recorded 
	the last entry per entity relation type.

2.8.0 - October 1, 2000

	I have found just a few days ago that I have uploaded to the Logtalk web 
	server a development version of Logtalk 2.7.0 instead of the final one!
	To avoid confusions I decided to release a new version.

	Changed implementation of the logtalk_compile/1-2 and logtalk_load/1-2 
	predicates to only accept a list of entities instead of either an entity 
	or a list of entities, simplifying and improving the performance of these 
	predicates. Improved error reporting for the logtalk_compile/1 and 
	logtalk_load/1 predicates. Updated relevant sessions in the user and 
	reference manuals.

	for the compare/3 predicate if it is not built-in in the corresponding 
	Prolog compiler. Also, default Logtalk compiler options are now also set 
	in the config files using the lgt_default_compiler_option/2 predicate.

	create_protocol/3 and create_category/4 to also detect invalid entity 
	identifiers.

	Updated the user and reference manuals to describe the new automatic 
	documenting features.

	Updated all HTML documentation to conform to HTML 4.01 strict standard.

	Corrected some wrong cross-reference links and titles in the reference 
	and user manuals HTML pages.

	PDF versions of the manuals and tutorial are now available in both A4 
	and US letter formats.

	Logtalk pre-processor updated to only report one warning per redefined
	Logtalk or Prolog built-in predicate.

	Changed some occurrences of atom "public" to "(public)" in 
	compiler/logtalk.pl file to avoid syntax errors in Prolog compilers

	Update config file for ALS Prolog to work with version 3.1.

	Updated configs/NOTES file include a workaround to use Logtalk with
	XSB 2.0, some guidelines on how to write loader utility files for

2.3.0 - September 12, 1999

	Metapredicate information is now stored with the other predicate 
	properties, instead of being discarded after compiling the clauses of
	a metapredicate. Added predicate property metapredicate/1. It is now 
	possible to assert clauses for dynamic metapredicates. 

	Corrected a bug in the processing of metacalls in pseudo-object user. 

	Corrected a bug in the implementation of private inheritance.
	Improved performance of protected inheritance.

	Corrected failure of processing initialization/1 and op/3 directives in

	Changed compilation of classes that do not instantiate any (meta)class
	in order to throw the correct exception when a message is sent to them.

	Changed compilation of root objects (that do not instantiate, specialize 
	or extend other objects) so that calls to "super" (^^/1) fail (as they 
	should) instead of generating a "predicate does not exist" error message.

	Changed implementation of "super" calls (^^/1) to avoid a potential 
	endless loop problem when using these calls from the inheritance root 
	object of a reflexive class-based systems.

	Pre-processor now checks for callable and object identifier errors.
	Runtime now checks for non-instantiated messages.

	Added new example (inheritance) about public, protected and private 
	inheritance.

	New Logtalk built-in predicates instantiates_class/3, extends_object/3,
	extends_protocol/3, specializes_class/3, imports_category/3 and
	implements_protocol/3. The third argument returns the relation scope.

	Pre-processor now checks most directive errors.

	Changed ^^/1 (super call) implementation to only allow the use of a 
	single predicate call for argument and to retain the original sender
	of the message (see the updated sicstus example).

	Fixed bug that prevented directives with a variable number of arguments
	(like dynamic(), public(), uses(), ...) being recognized.

	Changed definition of predicate read_term/3 in the configs files of Amzi!,
	Aquarius, Arity, Eclipse, IC, K, LPA Mac&WIN, Master and XSB to always
	instantiates the singleton variables list to the empty list. Needed to
	prevent backtracking problems in logtalk_load/1 and logtalk_compile/1
	predicates.

	Removed choice-point in processing metacalls in predicate definitions.

	A banner with the Logtalk version is printed after loading the runtime/
	pre-processor.

	compilers.

	Changed mode operators priority and type to be compatible with the ISO
	standard.

	Modified definition of predicate read_term/3 in the config file for Amzi 
	compiler to return the atom end_of_file instead of '!EOF' at the end of
	a file (this prevented Logtalk to complete compilation any file under 
	this compiler). Improved detection of built-in predicates while compiling.

	the documentation regarding thrown errors and to accept a list of
	entities to compile/load.

	Modified the examples loader utility files to make only a call to
	logtalk_load/1 by using a list of entities. This should make it easy to
	modify these files for compilers that don't support arbritrary queries
	in a file. 

	Logtalk runtime no longer tries to catch some of the errors thrown 
	by ::/2.

	Added to all config files a Logtalk predicate to check if a file 
	exists in the current working directory (used by the logtalk_load/1
	and logtalk_compile/1 Logtalk built-in predicates).

	New configs files for the K-Prolog 4.14 and Calypso 1.0b6 Prolog 
	compilers.

	Completed the config file for Open Prolog 1.03d38 (with the exception
	of lgt_current_date/3 that still have a dummy definition).

	Added a missing definition for Logtalk predicate forall/2 to the config
	file for Prolog II+ 4.4.

	running on Open Prolog or Calypso and to remove some redundant
	choice-points that are being created when compiling categories and
	protocols.

	Modified some examples that use operators to avoid syntax errors in
	some Prolog compilers.

	Modified the implementation of the built-in method 
	predicate_property/2 to avoid duplicate answers and to throw an
	instantiation error if the first argument is not bound.

	Modified definition of the pseudo-object user to hide Logtalk pre-
	processor predicates from the current_predicate/1 built-in method and
	to ensure that the predicate_property/2 built-in method returns
	Logtalk defined predicate properties for built-in Logtalk and Prolog
	predicates.

	Modified Prolog code generated by the pre-processor to further minimize
	possible conflicts with user defined predicates.
