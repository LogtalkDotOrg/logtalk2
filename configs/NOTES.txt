This file contains some notes about the config files provided. If you
improve or correct some of these files, or write new ones for other
Prolog compilers, please send me a copy. It is impossible for me to 
individually test Logtalk under all combinations of compatible Prolog 
versions and operating-system versions (or, for that mater, to own a 
copy of each one of these compilers). For some of these Prolog compilers 
I only have the manuals available on-line.

As a general rule, always try to use the latest version of your Prolog 
compiler of choice. For Prolog compilers with long release cycles, this 
may imply use of development versions. Most Prolog compilers are moving 
towards better ISO Standard compatibility and, as a consequence, improved 
Logtalk compatibility.

Most of the suggestions you will find in this file for integrating Logtalk 
with specific Prolog compilers are already implemented and available in the 
"integration" directory of the Logtalk distribution.


template config file

	template.pl

	If a config file for your favorite Prolog is not available, use this 
	file as a template for writing one. For each predicate in the file, 
	check if it is built-in in your Prolog, available in a library, or if 
	you can write a better definition.


ALS Prolog 3.1

	als.pl

	Only a few tests have been done with this compiler. One known problem: an
	ALS bug in operator handling that make calls like "\+ ::Pred" be 
	interpreted like "::(\+ Pred)" instead of "\+ (::Pred)". A workaround is 
	to replace all occurrences of "\+ ::Pred" by "\+ (::Pred)" and all 
	occurrences of "\+ Obj::Pred" by "\+ (Obj::Pred)". Please report any other 
	problems that you might find. Don't forget to use the cd/1 predicate to 
	set the working directory before loading the library or an example. Consult 
	the file builtins/comp_d10.pro in the ALS Prolog installation directory in 
	order to get the definition of predicate numbervars/3 needed by the Logtalk 
	built-in debugger. Supports smart compilation of source files. Does not 
	support the "altdirs" compiler flag.


Amzi! Prolog 7.6.1 and later versions

	amzi.pl

	For Amzi! Prolog 7.6.1 and later versions. You need to patch the Logtalk 
	compiler (the "compiler/logtalk.pl" file) by searching for all calls of 
	':'/2 and wrap them inside call/1. For better performance, use the Amzi! 
	"acmp" command-line compiler to compile the files "configs/amzi.pl",
	"compiler/logtalk.pl", and "libpaths/libpaths.pl" and then load the 
	resulting ".plm" files using the predicate load/1 (you will need to 
	edit the "libpaths.pl" file by following the instructions on the 
	"libpaths/NOTES.txt" file).

	One potential problem is that the compiler definition of the compare/3 
	built-in predicate returns the atom == instead of = for identical terms 
	(contrary to every other Prolog compiler!). Search the library files for 
	all calls of the compare/3 predicate and make the necessary changes.
	The built-in sort/2 predicate does not eliminate duplicates, which may 
	result in problems with some of the examples. Don't forget to use the 
	chdir/1 predicate to set the working directory before loading a library 
	or an example.


B-Prolog 7.1 and later versions

	b.pl

	For B-Prolog 7.1 and later versions. Don't forget to use the chdir/1 
	predicate to set the working directory before loading the library or 
	an example. Note that this configuration file redefines the B-Prolog 
	::/2 finite-domain built-in predicate (you may use the alternative 
	in/2 predicate instead).

	Some of the B-Prolog built-in predicates (e.g. set_to_list/2 or (@=)/2) 
	are not core predicates and can be redefined by the user. The predicate 
	predicate_property/2 does not return the property "built_in" for these 
	predicates. The solution is to encapsulate calls to these predicates 
	within objects and categories using the Logtalk {}/1 control construct.

	You can generate a new Prolog top level that includes the config file, the
	Logtalk compiler/runtime, and the library paths file by doing something 
	like:

		| ?- set_prolog_flag(redefined, off).

		| ?- compile(['configs/b.pl', 'compiler/logtalk.pl', 'libpaths/libpaths.pl']).
	
	These calls will result in the creation of three files, "b.out", 
	"logtalk.out", and "libpaths.out". Place these files on the $BPDIR 
	directory and then copy the "bp" script to a "bplgt" file and modify it 
	by adding the names of the three *.out files after the "$BPDIR/bp.out" 
	file (prefixing them with $BPDIR/). You will probably need to increase 
	the sizes of the code areas on the "bplgt" script if you run into 
	out-of-memory errors with complex applications.


Bin-Prolog 8.x~10.x

	bin.pl

	Start BinProlog using "bp -l4". You will need to create project files to 
	workaround the restriction of only one top-level file per interactive 
	session. For instance, the project file for the "metapredicates" example
	will look like (in the Unix version):
	
		:- ['$LOGTALKUSER/configs/bin.pl'].
		:- ['$LOGTALKHOME/compiler/logtalk.pl'].
		
		:- ['$LOGTALKUSER/examples/metapredicates/meta.pl'].
		:- ['$LOGTALKUSER/examples/metapredicates/sort1.pl'].
		...
	
	You will probably want to have a project file including only the config
	and the pre-processor/runtime files (logtalk.pl) in order to compile the
	examples using logtalk_compile/1-2 (do NOT use logtalk_load/1-2 or the 
	provided loader files). Don't forget to call the cd/1 predicate to set 
	the working directory before compiling the library or an example. 
	Supports smart compilation of source files.

	Updated and tested with help of Arun Majumdar.


CIAO Prolog 1.8p2 to 1.10#8

	ciao.pl
	ciao_aux.pl

	The "ciao.pl" file is just a loader file containing two include/1 
	directives which load the "ciao_aux.pl" and the Logtalk compiler/
	runtime. You must edit the contents of the file "ciao.pl" to match 
	your operating system (the include directive arguments are file paths 
	that differ between operating systems).

	The definition of the predicate '$lgt_predicate_property'/2 in the file 
	"ciao_aux.pl" is a bit of a hack, but should enable you to run the 
	Logtalk companion examples and to try out your own Logtalk programs. 

	You need to patch the Logtalk compiler (compiler/logtalk.pl) and comment
	out the multifile declaration for the predicate logtalk_library_path/2 
	in order to use library notation for loading library and example files.

	Don't forget to call the cd/1 predicate to set the working directory 
	before compiling the library or an example (you will need first to 
	load the library system that exports the cd/1 predicate by calling the 
	goal use_module(library(system)). Supports smart compilation of source 
	files.


CxProlog 0.97.2 or later versions

	cx.pl

	Developed and tested with the help of the CxProlog author, Artur Miguel
	Dias. Don't forget to call the fs_cwd/1 predicate to set the working 
	directory before compiling the library or an example. Supports smart 
	compilation of source files.


ECLiPSe 5.10#26 or later versions

	eclipse5.pl
	eclipse5iso.pl

	There are two configs files for this compiler. The first one, named 
	"eclipse5.pl", should be used when, for some reason, you don't want 
	to load the "iso" library. The second file, "eclipse5iso.pl" contains 
	a call to load the "iso" library. Both config files may be used with
	ECLiPSe 5.10#26 or later versions.

	You should use the "eclipse5iso.pl" config file whenever possible.
	The "eclipse5.pl" config file may not contain all the necessary 
	definitions for ISO Prolog predicates that are needed for compiling 
	Logtalk itself, the Logtalk library, or the Logtalk examples. On the 
	other hand, some of the ECLiPSE features (e.g. array notation) are not 
	available when using the "iso" library.

	There is a clash between Logtalk and ECLiPSe regarding the ::/2 operator.
	You may still use the ::/2 operator defined on the ECLiPSe constraint 
	solver libraries by using explicit module qualification by writing 
	"{library:(Var::Domain)}" (replace "library" by the actual library name; 
	the {}/1 control construct allows you to bypass the Logtalk compiler).

	For improved performance, add the following calls to the top of all the 
	files in the "compiler" sub-directory:
	
		:- pragma(system).
		:- pragma(nodebug).

	These calls disables debugging support for the Logtalk compiler/runtime 
	Prolog code and mark the Logtalk predicates as built-ins. Make sure that 
	the library top-level is loaded if you want to use the Logtalk built-in 
	debugger.

	Adopted from a config file written and tested with help of Taner Bilgic 
	for Logtalk 1.x. Don't forget to use the cd/1 predicate to set the 
	working directory before loading the library or an example. Supports 
	smart compilation of source files.

	With this Prolog compiler, avoid reloading Logtalk source files declaring
	and defining dynamic predicates. Due to the semantics of the ECLiPSe 
	built-in predicate compile/1, new clauses for dynamic predicates are 
	appended to the old ones instead of replacing them.


ECLiPSe 6.0#37 or later versions

	eclipse6.pl
	eclipse6iso.pl

	(see comments above about ECLiPSe 5.10 version)


GNU Prolog 1.3.1 and later versions

	gnu.pl

	GNU Prolog supports the ISO Prolog standard. No problems expected. You 
	can generate a new Prolog top level that includes the config file and 
	the Logtalk compiler/runtime by doing something like:

		% cd $LOGTALKHOME

	Edit the compiler/logtalk.pl file and add the line ":- built_in." to 
	the top. Then:

		% gplc -o logtalk configs/gnu.pl compiler/logtalk.pl
		% mv logtalk /usr/local/bin/

	This way, every time you want to work with Logtalk you will just need 
	to type:

		% logtalk

	Don't forget to use the change_directory/1 predicate to set the working 
	directory before loading the library or an example. Supports smart 
	compilation of source files.


IF/Prolog 5.1 and later versions

	if.pl

	IF/Prolog 5.1 supports the ISO Prolog standard. No problems expected.
	Don't forget to use the cd/1 predicate to set the working directory 
	before loading the library or an example. Supports smart compilation 
	of source files. Does not support the "altdirs" compiler flag.


JIProlog 3.0.2-6 and later versions

	ji.pl

	Written with the help of the JIProlog author (but if you find any Logtalk 
	problem please report it to me). Don't forget to use the cd/1 predicate to 
	set the working directory before loading the library or an example. Some 
	examples may not compile or run due to work in progress regarding ISO 
	Prolog standard compliance. Supports smart compilation of source files.


K-Prolog 5.1.5 and and later 5.1.x versions

	k5.pl

	K-Prolog 5.1.2a supports the ISO Prolog standard. No problems expected. 
	Config file written and tested with the help of Nobukuni Kino. Don't 
	forget to use the cd/1 predicate to set the working directory before 
	loading the library or an example. Smart compilation of source files
	is not supported on Windows.


K-Prolog 6.0.4 and later versions

	k6.pl

	K-Prolog 6.0.4 supports the current ISO Prolog standard and features 
	from the draft core revision proposal. Don't forget to use the cd/1 
	predicate to set the working directory before loading the library or 
	an example. Smart compilation of source files is not supported on 
	Windows.


LPA MacProlog32 1.25

	lpamac.pl

	This is my old Prolog development environment. Two known problems: (1) an
	LPA bug in operator handling that make calls like "\+ ::Pred" be 
	interpreted like "::(\+ Pred)" instead of "\+ (::Pred)". A workaround is 
	to replace all occurrences of "\+ ::Pred" by "\+ (::Pred)"; (2) If you call 
	the \+ operator in your code the writeq/1 built-in don't always output a 
	space after the operator resulting in calls like "\+(...)". Because \+ is 
	not defined as a predicate this will fail. Don't forget to use the dvol/1 
	predicate to set the working directory before loading an example.
	Due to the size of the Logtalk pre-processor file, you must load it by 
	using the consult/1 predicate instead of using the File:Open menu option.
	Be aware that this configuration file redefines some built-ins that
	you may use in your own programs. You must be careful to not consult the 
	config file twice. Supports smart compilation of source files. Does not 
	support the "altdirs" compiler flag.


LPA WinProlog32 4.0x

	lpawin.pl

	Written with the help of the LPA support team. Of course, if you find any 
	bugs please direct your flames to me ;-). Be aware that this configuration 
	file redefines some built-ins that you may use in your programs. Don't 
	forget to use the chdir/1 predicate to set the working directory before 
	loading the library or an example. Be careful to not consult the config 
	file twice. Supports smart compilation of source files. Does not support 
	the "altdirs" compiler flag.


MasterProlog 4.1

	master.pl

	Written with the help of the MasterProlog support team (but if you find 
	any Logtalk problem please report it to me). 
	If in the MasterProlog version that you are using the implementation of 
	the close/1 predicate does not follow the ISO standard, you will have to 
	apply the following patch to the Logtalk pre-processor: replace every 
	call of close(...) with fclose(...).  Does not support the "altdirs" 
	compiler flag.


Open Prolog 1.1b5

	open.pl

	Limited test done. Please report any problems that you may find.
	Don't forget to use the set_folder/1 predicate to set the working 
	directory before loading the library or an example. Does not support 
	the "altdirs" compiler flag.


PrologII+ 4.5 and later versions

	prologII.pl

	Written and tested with the help of Claude Lai from PrologIA. You need
	to apply the following patches to the Logtalk pre-processor/runtime:
	Search and replace every instance of "quoted(true)" with "quoted(:true)";
	"open(File, write, Stream)" with "open(File, :write, Stream)",
	"catch(close(Stream), _, true)" with "catch(close(Stream), _, :true)",
	"open(File, read, Stream)" with "open(File, :read, Stream, [eof_action(eof_code)])".
	Remember that you need to use the set_import_dir/1 built-in predicate to
	set the working directory before loading the library or an example.
	Does not support the "altdirs" compiler flag.


Qu-Prolog 8.1 and later versions

	qu.pl

	In order to compile and load both the config file and the Logtalk compiler,
	the following sequence of steps is advised.

	First, start Qu-Prolog using adequate switches. For example:

		% qp -T 16 -s 2048 -d 1024 -h 2000

	Second, compile and load the config file using:

		| ?- fcompile('qu.ql', [assemble_only(true)]), load(qu).

	Next, compile and load the Logtalk compiler:

		| ?- chdir('../compiler/'), fcompile('logtalk.pl', [assemble_only(true), string_table(256)]), load(logtalk).

	Finally, compile and load the library paths file:

		| ?- chdir('../libpaths/'), fcompile('libpaths.pl', [assemble_only(true)]), load(libpaths).

	Don't forget to use the chdir/1 predicate to set the working directory 
	before loading the library or an example.

	Written and tested with the help of Peter Robinson.


Quintus Prolog 3.3~3.5

	quintus.pl

	Written and tested with help of a friend of mine, Paulo Urbano, for a 
	previous version. Adopted (but not tested) for the current release by
	using information available on-line in the internet. You need to patch 
	the Logtalk compiler due to the different argument order of the built-in 
	predicates read_term/3 and open/4: for all calls of both predicates, 
	exchange the last two arguments. Don't forget to use the unix(cd(Dir)) 
	predicate to set the working directory before loading the library or an 
	example. Supports smart compilation of source files.


SICStus Prolog 3.8~3.12.x

	sicstus3.pl
	
	For versions 3.8.x~3.12.x. The config file sets the flag language to 
	iso, but that is only recommended and should not be needed to run Logtalk.
	No problems expected although not fully tested. Don't forget to use the 
	SICStus working_directory/2 predicate to set the working directory before 
	loading the library or an example. Supports smart compilation of source 
	files.

	If you want SICStus Prolog to automatically load Logtalk at startup, then 
	add the following lines to your ~/.sicstusrc or ~/.sicstus.ini initialization
	file:
	
		:- compile('$LOGTALKUSER/configs/sicstus3.pl').
		:- compile('$LOGTALKHOME/compiler/logtalk.pl').
		:- compile('$LOGTALKUSER/libpaths/libpaths.pl').

    Consult the SICStus Prolog documentation for further information on the 
    ~/.sicstusrc and ~/.sicstus.ini user initialization files.


SICStus Prolog 4.0.x

	sicstus4.pl

	Config file for the SICStus Prolog 4.0 version (tested with the MacOS X 
	version and the Windows beta version).


SWI Prolog 5.6.44 and later versions

	swi.pl
	swihook.pl
	xpcehook.pl

	No problems expected. Please report any problem found (with a solution 
	if possible). Don't forget to use the cd/1 predicate to set the working 
	directory before loading the library or an example. Supports smart 
	compilation of source files. To improve the integration between Logtalk 
	and SWI-Prolog edit the compiler/logtalk.pl file and add the line 
	":- system_module." to the top of the file. You may also load the file 
	configs/swihook.pl in order to be able to load Logtalk entities using 
	SWI-Prolog load_files/2 and consult/1 predicates.

	If you want SWI-Prolog to automatically load Logtalk at startup, then 
	add the following lines to your pl.ini (on Windows):

		:- ['drive:\\path to logtalk user folder\\configs\\swi.pl'].
		:- ['drive:\\path to logtalk installation\\compiler\\logtalk.pl'].
		:- ['drive:\\path to logtalk installation\\libpaths\\libpaths.pl'].

	 or to your .plrc (on MacOS X, Linux, Unix, and similar systems):
	
		:- ['$LOGTALKUSER/configs/swi.pl'].
		:- ['$LOGTALKHOME/compiler/logtalk.pl'].
		:- ['$LOGTALKUSER/libpaths/libpaths.pl'].

	See the SWI-Prolog documentation for further information on the .plrc 
	and pl.ini user initialization files.

	The config file sets the "iso" SWI-Prolog flag to "true". This setting 
	may improve compatibility of Logtalk code across different back-end 
	Prolog compilers buy may also cause compatibility problems with some 
	SWI-Prolog libraries. Comment out the corresponding set_prolog_flag/2 
	call if necessary.

	If you intend to use Logtalk and XPCE at the same time, you may load the 
	configs/xpcehook.pl file in order to support Logtalk message sending goals 
	as XPCE call-back goals.

	With multi-threading support turned on, you may get an harmless message
	when halting the system regarding threads that wouldn't die: you can 
	suppress the message on POSIX systems by using "% swilgt 2> /dev/null".

	The definition of the predicate {}/1 in the config file conflicts with 
	the "clpq" and "clpr" SWI-Prolog constraint libraries. The {}/1 predicate
	is used in Logtalk as a shortcut to the logtalk_load/1 built-in predicate.
	Comment out the definition in the config file if necessary. Note that 
	Logtalk also defines a {}/1 control construct but this is only used within
	objects and categories.


XSB 3.1 and later versions

	xsb.pl

	Don't forget to use the cd/1 predicate to set the working directory 
	before loading the library or an example. Supports smart compilation 
	of source files. Support for the Logtalk multi-threading features 
	requires XSB CVS version.


YAP 5.1.3 and later versions

	yap.pl

	Don't forget to use the cd/1 predicate to set the working directory 
	before loading the library or an example. Supports smart compilation 
	of source files. Support for the Logtalk multi-threading features 
	requires YAP CVS version.
