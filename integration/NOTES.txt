This directory contains Prolog integration shell scripts and corresponding
auxiliary Prolog files.

On POSIX systems, the Logtalk installers make the following integration 
scripts available from the command-line (you may need to adjust your 
system path):

* B-Prolog (version 7.1 or later):       bplgt
* Ciao (version 1.10):                   ciaolgt    (first run must use sudo)
* CxProlog (version 0.97.1 or later):    cxlgt
* ECLiPSe (versions 5.10, 6.0):          eclipselgt
* GNU Prolog (version 1.3.1 or later):   gplgt
* K-Prolog (versions 5.1.5, 6.0.4):      plclgt
* Qu-Prolog (version 8.9 or later):      qplgt
* Quintus Prolog (version 3.5):          quintuslgt (requires patching Logtalk)
* SICStus Prolog (versions 3.12.x, 4.x): sicstuslgt
* SWI-Prolog (version 5.6.44 or later):  swilgt
* XSB (version 3.2 or later):            xsblgt     (first run must use sudo)
* XSB 64 bits (version 3.2 or later):    xsb64lgt   (first run must use sudo)
* XSB MT (version 3.2 or later):         xsbmtlgt   (first run must use sudo)
* XSB MT 64 bits (version 3.2 or later): xsbmt64lgt (first run must use sudo)
* YAP (version 5.1.3 or later):          yaplgt

Integration with Quintus Prolog requires manual patches that render
Logtalk incompatible with all the other compilers.

On Windows systems, the Logtalk installer makes the Prolog integration 
shortcuts available from the "Start Menu/Programs/Logtalk" menu.

The first run of the Ciao and XSB integration scripts must be made by an 
user with administrative rights (on POSIX systems, run them once as root 
or using sudo; in Windows systems run them once from an administrative 
account).

The GNU Prolog integration script provides adequate performance for 
development. For production environments, improved performance may be 
achieved by generating a new GNU-Prolog top-level that includes Logtalk.

Other Prolog compilers require manual steps for integration with Logtalk.
See the "configs/NOTES.txt" file for details.

The environment variables LOGTALKHOME and LOGTALKUSER should be defined 
in order to run the integration scripts (see the "INSTALL.txt" file for 
details on setting the variables). When the scripts detect an outdated 
Logtalk user directory, they create a new one by running the "cplgtdirs.sh" 
script (a backup is automatically made of the old directory).

Note that the integration scripts and shortcuts may fail if you use non-
standard locations for your Prolog compilers.

Depending on the size and complexity of your Logtalk applications, you 
may need to change the integration scripts in order to allocate more 
memory to the back-end Prolog compilers. Please consult the documentation 
on the Prolog compilers you intend to use for details.

All the scripts accept command-line options, which are passed straight to 
the back-end Prolog compiler. For example (on a POSIX operating-system, 
using SWI-Prolog as the back-end compiler):

	% swilgt -g "write('Hello world!'), nl"

However, keep in mind that the integration scripts already use the back-end 
Prolog command-line option that allows a initialization file to be loaded 
in order to bootstrap Logtalk. See the scripts files for details.
