Quick start
===========


1. Open the manuals/index.html file with a web browser.

2. Select the Tutorial link. This will provide you with a basic understanding
of the main Logtalk concepts.

3. Go back to the index.html file and select the User Manual link and then 
the Installing and running Logtalk link. This will provide you with a basic 
understanding of how to start Logtalk and compile and load Logtalk code.


Assuming that Logtalk supports your Prolog compiler:

1. Read the NOTES file in the configs sub-directory to check if any patch 
or workaround is needed for your compiler.

2. Start your Prolog compiler.

3. Compile and load the config file for your Prolog compiler.

4. Compile and load the Logtalk pre-processor/runtime found in the compiler 
sub-directory.

Note that both the configuration files and the compiler/pre-processor 
files are Prolog files. The predicate called to load these files depends 
on your Prolog compiler. In case of doubt, consult your Prolog compiler 
reference manual or take a look at the definition of the predicate 
$lgt_load_prolog_code/1 in the configuration file. 


Now you can try some of the included examples:

1. Open the examples sub-directory. There you find several sub-directories
with ready to run examples and a NOTES file containing a brief description 
of each example. Select and open one of the examples sub-directory.

3. Read the example NOTES file. Some examples are dependent on other examples 
or on library objects. You may need to load additional files before running 
the chosen example.

4. Change the working directory of your Prolog compiler to the example 
directory. If you don't know what predicate to use, check the configs/NOTES 
file or your Prolog reference manual.

5. Compile and load the file named <example name>.loader. This will compile 
and load all the example files. Note that the loader file is a Prolog file.

6. Open the example SCRIPT file. One by one, copy&paste or drag&drop the 
queries in the file to your Prolog top-level.

7. Enjoy!


Ready to start writing your own programs?

1. Take a look at the wenv sub-directory. There you will find syntax 
configuration files for popular text editors that enable syntax coloring 
when editing Logtalk source files.

2. Create a sub-directory with a suitable name to hold all the files of your 
program.

3. Copy to this sub-directory a *.loader file form one of the examples and 
modify it to load your own object files.
